This concern is particularly evident in complex knowledge-intensive organizations. Learning institutions and corporations often don?t pay attention to the data trails that learners create in the process of accessing learning materials, interacting with educators and peers, and creating new content. In an age where institutions are under growing pressure to adjust and adapt rapidly, learning and knowledge analytics hold opportunities for improved decision-making and planning at institutions levels.  Advances in knowledge modeling and representation, the semantic web, data mining, analytics, and open data form a foundation for new approaches of  knowledge development and analysis. The technical complexity of this field is paralleled by a transition within schools and organizations to consider the full spectrum of learning (education, work place learning, informal learning) while transitioning to social and networked learning models. These technical, pedagogical, and social domains are amplified when they are considered in relation to one another ? a foundational philosophy of this course.  Introduction to Learning and Knowledge Analytics 2011 is an overview course detailing the role of analytics in learning and knowledge development. Most of the topics do not require advanced statistical methods or technical skills.    Course Objectives  After completing this course, the student should be able to:   Define learning and knowledge analytics and detail how these differ from educational data mining  Map the developments of technologies and practices that influence learning and knowledge analytics as well as developments and trends peripheral to the field.  Evaluate prominent analytics methods and tools and determine appropriate contexts where the methods would be most effective.  Describe how ?big data? and data-driven decision making differ from traditional decision making and the potential implications of this transition in education, training, and general organizational functioning.  Evaluate ?intelligent curriculum? as a basis for future content development and its connection to analytics.  Design and implement a model deploying learning analytics relating to a course or specific area of study  Evaluate the potential impact of the semantic web and linked data on the development of learning resources and curriculum.  Detail various principles that organizational leaders need to consider in order to roll out an integrated knowledge and learning analytics model in an organizational setting.  Describe and evaluate developing trends in learning and knowledge analytics and determine their potential impact on teaching, learning, and organizational knowledge.     Outline  This course will introduce learners to how information quantity alters its qualitative attributes. In the early 1970?s, PW Anderson stated that ?more is different?. Throughout this course, discussion will centre on how abundance of information requires new technologies and analysis methods in order to decide and act meaningfully. Concepts of wayfinding and sensemaking in complex settings will be addressed through emerging technologies, social networks, and analysis methods. Additionally, learners will be asked to consider organizational and cultural barriers that hamper analytics-based decision-making in companies.

This course is not available for challenge credit  Faculty: Faculty of Science and Technology  Centre: School of Computing and Information Systems  Instructor: Dr. Jon Dron   **Note: This is a graduate level course and students need to apply and be approved to one of the graduate programs or as a non-program School of Computing and Information Student graduate student in order to take this course.  Minimum Admission Requirements must be met.  Undergraduate students who do not meet admission requirement will not normally be permitted to take this course. http://scis.athabascau.ca/          Important Links   Future Course Offerings  Important Dates and Deadlines  MSc IS Contact Information     Overview  This is mainly a course about databases, how they fit into an organization, what needs they seek to address and what can be done with them. This is set in the context of understanding the information needs of an organization and exploring how and when such information is needed. The emphasis throughout is not so much on achieving high levels of technical competence in advanced technologies but on being able to manage information in a manner that benefits an organization. In order to illustrate and contextualize such high level concepts and ground them in something more concrete, you will need to come to practical grips with technologies of data modeling (including normalization), the SQL language, and several practical database management tools and methods. It is ideally suited to the hybrid manager, able to communicate with and understand the needs of both technologists and the end-users of technologies within an organization.    Course Objectives  This course aims to:   introduce students to the design, construction and management of relational database systems  provide opportunities to gain knowledge of processes, tools and techniques involved in information management within an enterprise  facilitate the application of knowledge of database-driven systems within a business context  enable critical comparisons to be made between a range of database technologies and methods of database construction  support research into current areas of interest in information management     Learning Outcomes  At the end of this course, successful students will have presented evidence that they are able to   analyze business data needs and requirements for data-driven systems  apply appropriate methodologies to the design of data-driven systems  install and manage a database management system  write queries to retrieve, update and insert data using a database management system in accordance with business needs  create and implement effective security policies and procedures to fit business needs and address potential threats  apply methods of data optimization and performance improvement to address business data needs  manage faults and use fault-prevention techniques in a database management system  argue the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches to data management  solve problems in technology, technique and process relating to database management and design  independently and reflectively research issues, technologies, processes and tools in information management critically evaluate information and data technologies in the context of organizational needs  be a reflective practitioner in the information management field  We hope too that students will have enhanced and refined generic skills such as essay writing, presentation, and use of digital technologies in this domain.     Outline  The course comes in two parts, both of which will centre around a single scenario that you will choose in the second week of the course. The first part, Foundations, provides a practical introduction to some common technologies and management processes that every information management practitioner should know. It introduces some of the foundations needed to deal with the most common form of database, the relational database management system. In this section we will cover topics such as business information concepts, data modelling, SQL and some of the major database management issues, as well as brief explorations of different kinds of database technology and how they relate to business and organizational needs. The second part of the course is far more flexible and allows you to research a topic of particular interest to you, applying the basic knowledge and principles developed in the first part of the course. It involves personal research into a wider range of technologies that support information needs within an organization. In this section you will consider more complex, situated and potentially wicked issues, producing a portfolio of reflections, research and a presentation on what you have found. Both parts of the course will be supported by an ongoing reflective learning diary which plays multiple roles as part of the learning process and as an assessable set of outputs of the course.   Week 1: Introduction  Week 2: Data Modeling: Basics  Week 3: Data Modeling: Diagramming  Week 4: Data Modeling: Normalization  Week 5: SQL  Week 6: Management: Performance management and capacity planning  Week 7: Management: Security and Fault Management  Week 8: Beyond the RDBMS: Web and Cloud Issues  Week 9: Beyond the RDBMS: no SQL  Week 10-13: Personal Research Project Initiation  Week 13: Presentations and portfolio assembly     Evaluation  There are two parts to the assessment of this course - foundations and project, both of which will relate to a scenario that you will identify by the end of the second week of the       course. Each part will be presented in the form of a portfolio in which you map evidence of what you have done within the course to the intended learning outcomes of the course, and will include not only direct outputs but also accompanying evidence that will include reflections and evidence from contributions to the learning community.  Within each TME, you will receive a mark for each required learning outcome it is intended to address. You must achieve a passing grade of C- for each of these required outcomes in order to pass a unit. Note that, for TME1, this includes all learning outcomes for the course.  For TME2 you may, if you wish , additionally submit evidence of having met optional learning outcomes for this part of the course.  To receive credits for COMP 602 toward the Master of Science in Information Systems Program, you must achieve a cumulative course grade of at least B- (70 percent), including an average grade of 60 percent for each required learning outcome it is intended to address.  To receive credit for COMP 602 toward the Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Data Analytics Program, you must achieve a cumulative course grade of at least C+ (66 percent), including an average grade of 60 percent for each required learning outcome it is intended to address.  To receive credit for COMP 602 as a non-program student, you must achieve a cumulative course grade of at least C+ (66 percent), including an average grade of 60 percent for each required learning outcome it is intended to address. The weighting of the composite grade is as follows:     Assessment  Weight    TMA 1 - Foundations Portfolio  60%    TMA 2 - Research Project Portfolio  40 %       Course Materials  Main Readings  This content is based on a growing shared collection of resources that are provided by the tutor and students/former students of the course through a social bookmarking system. As a result, content is fluid and ever-changing. The mix includes academic papers, online tools, and primary resources  Special Course Features  This is a read/write course to which all students are expected to contribute collaboratively (working together) as well as cooperatively (working individually but allowing others to benefit from the results).  The course requires engagement with others within the course and significant sharing of work produced, some of which is optional, some of which is required.  Optionally, students may engage on external sites. While guidelines and principles are provided to make this as safe as possible, such sites are beyond the control of the University.  Special Instructional Features  In keeping with the read/write ethos of the course, course members will contribute to the content, which will in some cases build for future cohorts and may utilize the work of others on previous cohorts. Students are therefore requested to leave work done on this course for the benefit of later students. The assessment is portfolio based and requires students to display evidence of having met the learning outcomes, which may be achieved in many different ways depending on interests and needs. Social software is used throughout to assist in the development of the learning community.    Athabasca University reserves the right to amend course outlines occasionally and without notice. Courses offered by other delivery methods may vary from their individualized-study counterparts.    Opened in Revision 3, March 11, 2012.

Students will also learn about the policies and regulations essential to the security of enterprise information systems.    Course Objectives  The objectives of the course are:   to explain various security issues associated with the development and deployment of information systems including Internet-based e-commerce, e-business and e-service systems  to teach essential technologies such as algorithms and protocols for encryption/decryption, authentication and key management required in developing secure information systems for enterprises,  to familiarize students with the tools, policies and regulations that are necessary for ensuring the security of enterprise information systems.     Learning Outcomes  After successfully completing this course, students should be able to   analyze the security risks of a specific information system,  set up appropriate security goals for the system, and  implement appropriate security technologies in a network environment or information system to achieve the set security goals and eliminate the identified security risks.     Outline  Unit 1: Introduction to Enterprise Information Security   This unit provides an overview of general security concepts, terminologies, issues, and some technical background such as computer networks and security models. After this unit, students should understand the concept of information security and the information security risks an enterprise may face, and be able to explain important concepts and  terminologies related to enterprise information security.   Unit 2:  Cryptography and Cryptology   Cryptography is about encryption and decryption. It sits at the centre of information security, and can be used for different purposes. In this unit, students will study both symmetric and asymmetric cryptography, including public key cryptography, data encryption standard (DES), international data encryption algorithm (IDEA), advanced encryption standard (AES), as well as algorithms for hashes and message digests. The focus will be on both the principles and the mechanisms of operation. After this unit, students should be able to describe the principles and features of some classical and modern cryptographic systems and algorithms. Students should also be able to choose the correct cryptographic scheme when needed.   Unit 3:  Authentication and Access Control   Information security means protecting information resources from unauthorized access while keeping them available to authorized users. To achieve this essential goal of information security, we must first authenticate users, and then authorize their rights of access to specific resources. In this unit, students will learn the meaning of authentication, how various authentication schemes work, and how access to information resources can be controlled in various access control models. After this unit, students should be able to explain how various authentication schemes work, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. Students should also be able to choose an appropriate authentication scheme for a given application.   Unit 4:  Security Standards, Protocols and Systems   In a networked environment (like the Internet), certain security goals can only be achieved through the collaboration of clients and servers. These computers collaborate by following certain standards and protocols, with the assistance of security systems. In this unit, students will learn about some well-known security systems, standards, and protocols: the Kerberos protocol; public key infrastructure (PKI); and security protocols for different network layers, particularly secure IP protocol (IPSec), Secure Socket Layer (SSL), and transport layer security (TLS). Protocols specially designed for e-commerce will also be covered, as will firewalls and VPNs that can be used to achieve certain security goals. After this unit, you should be able to describe some well-known security standards, explain how some well-known security protocols and systems work and how they are used, and interpret new security protocols when you encounter them.   Unit 5:  Systems Security   Today?s enterprises are heavily dependent on many types of computer-based systems, which store or transmit their information assets. The security of such systems is essential and critical to enterprises. In this unit, students will study security issues, and the technological requirements of systems commonly deployed and used by enterprises. After this unit, students should be able to explain the principle of firewalls. Students should also be able to describe the main security features of some well-known systems, as well as their weaknesses.   Unit 6:  Information Security Management   Securing the information asset of an enterprise can be very technical and costly; however, even with all the technologies, systems, and personnel in place, the security of an enterprise?s information assets cannot be guaranteed if the technologies and systems are not used properly, or the personnel is poorly trained. In this unit, students will study various management issues, technologies, and systems related to information security management at enterprises.

How do we make sense of the unprecedented amount of information available to us? This platform focuses on the process fundamental to addressing Canada?s greatest challenges: collecting and producing unique data sets, and turning this data into new insights, policies, and inventions.  With The Internet of Things, data is available on just about anything at just about any time, and with just about any level of resolution. Globally, data is generated, transmitted, and stored from satellites, sensor networks, and biosensor chips that observe our planet, solar system, oceans, landmasses, atmosphere, and humans in real time. Can we take this information and translate it into results, discoveries, and advancements?  Through our research, we aim to empower individuals and governments at all levels, to make decisions based on accurate and predictable data. This can range from acute financial decisions to escaping hazardous weather. The insights we seek are often hidden and encoded.  Using sophisticated statistics, pattern recognition, and state of the art experiments, we can work on finding these insights with increasing predictability. Visualization helps us understand this complex data, while analytics and statistics extract relationships and trends. Modelling helps us understand and predict the behaviours that will shape the world around us. Research in this platform crosscuts all disciplines from human-computer interaction to geospatial intelligence.

Information is extracted from the data that is constantly gathered about us: our likes and dislikes, our friends, our purchases. This presents us with a large number of technical, social, and policy problems:  How do we store and organize large amounts of data?  How do we keep our information, and the computers that hold it, safe?  How do we analyze large datasets to extract information?  How can data be managed to protect our privacy?  How can specific forms of information, like intellectual property, be protected?  How is information kept secure on the ""wild west"" of the Internet?  How do we manage and secure devices like sensors that produce increasingly more data?  How do we protect ourselves from future threats to our information society?  How do we find what we want in all this data?   Faculty  Reda Alhajj does research in the areas of character recognition, biocomputing and biodata analysis, data mining, data models, data grid, mobile databases, multiagent systems, object-oriented databases, query languages, schema integration and re-engineering, view maintenance, web databases: keyword search and database selection, and XML.

30,http://www.royalroads.ca/prospective-students/bachelor-science-environmental-science/outcomes,"Outcomes | Royal Roads University | Victoria, BC",www.royalroads.ca,"                             Skip to main content                Main Menu                                 Moodle    MyAdmin    Webmail    Groups    Book a room              Search      Search                      Home Prospective Students Programs Environment & Sustainability BSc in Environmental Science (on-campus)                Prospective Students    Programs Business  Communication & Culture  Education & Technology  Environment & Sustainability MA in Environment and Management  MA in Environmental Education and Communication  MA in Environmental Practice (online)  MSc in Environment and Management  MSc in Environmental Practice (online)  Graduate Diploma in Environmental Education and Communication  Graduate Certificate in Environmental Education and Communication  Graduate Certificate in Sustainable Community Development  BA in Environmental Practice (online)  BSc in Environmental Management (blended)  BSc in Environmental Practice (online)  BSc in Environmental Science (on-campus)   Executive Education  General Studies  Humanitarian Studies  Interdisciplinary Studies  Leadership Studies  Professional & Continuing Studies  Tourism & Hospitality   Student Experience  Admission  Tuition & Fees  Financial Aid & Awards  Indigenous Students  Canadian Forces Students  International Students        Share Royal Roads Online    Email  Twitter  Facebook  Linked In             Outcomes      Graduates of the BSc in Environmental Science program will have a broad range of technical, communication, analytical, and interpersonal skills, together with a firm grounding in environmental science. These skill sets have been defined as requirements for employment in the environmental sector. They can be summarized as follows:  A?broad technical training in the physical, chemical and natural sciences, focused on their application to environmental management and the understanding of the effects of human activity on natural systems and the health of living organisms.  A broad training in social-cultural issues, economics, ethics, business, legal and government regulation fields, focused on their application to balancing societal development needs with environmental sustainability.  An understanding of the more significant industrial processes and other human activities that can affect the environment, along with the technology and management strategies to prevent, control and remedy those effects.  Skills to communicate effectively, think creatively, deal effectively with conflict and risk, solve problems systematically and to use the relevant tools (computers, sampling and analytical, monitoring, technical references, etc.).  Practical experience in the application of key elements of the above.  Given these learning outcomes, it is clear that a conventional curriculum, organized by departments and taught by disciplinary specialists each responsible only for a specific section of the curriculum is inappropriate. To produce a graduate in which all the requirements of the program are well integrated, so that they understand environmental science as a complex professional undertaking which involves a great many skills operating simultaneously, requires a program which stresses integration in its basic structure and in the learning environment. This accounts in part for the integrated, interdisciplinary modular structure of the program.  If through the integrated modular design, the student experiences the program as a totality, rather than as an aggregate of unrelated courses taught by individuals who have little to do with each other, then the major task of integrating all the specific outcomes becomes that much easier to achieve, and many of the important outcomes will be realized in the process of the co-operative learning which goes on. In addition, the rapid pace of the program will require the richest possible social context to enable students to cope with the pressure.  In addition, the curriculum will be project driven as much as possible, that is, the classroom instruction should be linked as closely to field, laboratory or research projects which the students plan, carry out, report upon, and critique, as well as upon case studies and legal judgments of issues directly relevant to environmental science. The main emphasis in the curriculum is not on covering all the possible content that a student might need to know in a variety of future tasks, but on the skills necessary to acquire and apply the relevant knowledge in particular situations. Demonstrated competency in carrying out particular tasks which mirror the outcomes would thus be a more important principle than passing conventional examinations assessing the student's mastery of a well-defined content.  Similarly, in developing analytical and critical thinking skills, the interdisciplinary modular program would stress case studies, practical examples of environmental problems and solutions, which the students would read, discuss, report on, and evaluate. In this way, the most wide-ranging issues of environmental studies would be linked, as much as possible, to the student's direct experience of practical and immediately relevant examples.  All students will bring to the program certain analytical skills, knowledge, and awareness of environmental issues. The major aim of the pedagogy in the program will be to increase the student's ability to analyze problems, to recognize the complexity of environmental issues, and to apply problem solving skills to particular environmental problems. This is a far more important goal than increasing the sum total of the student's knowledge of environmental science. Hence, the methods of pedagogy and assessment in the program will stress the process of learning, with, for example, continuous evaluation of the development of environmental awareness and problem solving skills, as demonstrated in the carrying out of particular projects, major and minor, rather than a series of final exams to test the student's retention of the content of particular modules.  Finally, given the importance in the list of outcomes of communication and interpersonal skills, the integrated nature of the program seeks to foster a learning environment in which the students can learn from each other in a number of different situations, rather than going through the program isolated from the group of peers (as is frequently possible in a traditional discipline-based academic undergraduate education) or in a repetitive classroom format. The objectives which are best realized by practice in interpersonal relationships are properly fostered only if the curriculum requires and encourages the students to deal with each other on a day-to-day basis in a variety of problem solving tasks.  Specific Outcomes for the Program  Mastery of Background and Key Fundamental Concepts  Demonstrates broad level of skills and knowledge in written communication and English.

The results showed high levels of metal contamination above CCME and BCCSR Residential/Parkland and Industrial/Commercial criteria throughout the site. Various options for the remediation were reviewed, and a recommendation was made that the most appropriate was to excavate the material for disposal elsewhere and rehabilitate the site as a wetland. The recommendations were followed, and the site was rehabilitated. A later project designed a 5-year monitoring protocol for the wetland after its construction, and future projects will continue the monitoring and develop the site as an education and training location for similar projects.  Pollution Reduction Framework for a Major Corporation  The project team developed a pollution reduction framework for a major corporation. The project outlined steps to reduce the corporation?s environmental impact, while allowing the corporation to benefit financially through reduction of the amount of landfilled material. In developing this framework, a waste audit was completed, along with an assessment of the current recycling system, packaging and purchasing practices. Options for increased recycling and composting of waste materials were developed.  Developing a Mobility Options Program for a Major Employer  The team worked with a major employer to examine transportation options for employees aimed at reducing greenhouse gas and other emissions and traffic congestion. A Mobility Options Program (MOPs) was developed to improve employee transportation options.  Sooke River Watershed Assessment  The objective of the project was to determine the current state of the lower reaches of Sooke River and De Mamiel Creek. Background research, sampling, and the formation of a GIS database were used to assess potential linkages between non-point source pollution from the Sooke River and the health of the shellfish industry.  Development of a Recreation Plan for the Coburg Peninsula and the Esquimalt Lagoon  This project developed a recreation plan for the Coburg Peninsula that sought to lessen human impacts on the flora and fauna (including terrestrial and aquatic species) found on the spit and in Esquimalt Lagoon, while maintaining an enjoyable and rewarding recreational experience for human visitors to the area.  Monitoring the Restoration of Douglas Creek  The project developed a monitoring protocol for restoration efforts at Douglas Creek. The team established monitoring sites and conducted benchmark surveys of benthicmacroinvertebrate populations, fecal coliform counts, and hydrometric attributes. The team produced a database to allow the entry of indicator population and hydrometric data from different protocols. The project also worked with local community groups to develop long-term monitoring procedures to facilitate the tracking of important trends as watershed restoration efforts progress. A separate major project focused on improving storm water management for the Douglas Creek watershed.  Provincial Integrated Roadside Vegetation Management Requirements  The team developed a series of guidelines and recommendations to facilitate the development of improved roadside vegetation management plans. The plans integrated highway safety and function with aesthetic and ecological considerations. The team worked with highway contractors to implement the plan.  Development of an Environmental Management System for RRU  The project helped create a computer based Environmental Management System framework using ISOsoft 14001 software. An ISO 14001 Tier 1 Manual was created, and training and awareness activities were implemented to ensure successful certification to the ISO 14001 standard.  Annual Variation of Invasive Plant Species Cover within Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network (EMAN) Sites  This ongoing project conducts invasive plant species monitoring and multidisciplinary long-term ecological studies for an Ecological Monitoring and Assessment Network (EMAN) location at RRU. The study focused on the Coastal Douglas Fir Biogeoclimactic Zone, and contributed to Canada-wide research on ecosystem dynamics.  Air Chemistry Background Analysis at RRU  An ongoing air chemistry project uses the RRU meteorological station to monitor and test precipitation and particulate matter to provide air quality data for the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative. The project seeks to determine the source of the low pH precipitation values found on Vancouver Island, compare the RRU meteorological station data with other stations found in the CRD, and improve the current method, AP-42, of estimating backyard burning emissions in British Columbia. The RRU meteorological station is equipped to measure particulate matter, precipitation, temperature, humidity, wind speed and wind direction.           Can we help you?

						Admission Requirements                   ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS       Admission to the Professional Master's Program in Big Data is competitive: only the best qualified applicants are offered a seat. Therefore, it is imperative that students familiarize themselves with the admission requirements in order to ensure they submit a strong application. Since conditional and qualifying admission offers are made rarely and only in exceptional cases, students who qualify for regular admission have higher chances of acceptance than those who only qualify for conditional or qualifying admission.     REGULAR ADMISSION   Regular admission is the preferred route for the Professional Master's Program in Big Data. To qualify, students must satisfy the Big Data admission requirements laid out here as well as the University's admission requirements for a master's program, as stated in SFU Graduate Regulation 1.3.3 .  Students must hold a bachelor's degree or equivalent in computer science or a related field with a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of at least 3.00/4.33 (B), or a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.33/4.33 (B+) based on the last 60 credits of undergraduate courses. All graduate work is also considered. It is expected that successful applicants have strong programming skills, particularly in languages like Java, Python, and C++. In exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted with lower formal qualifications when there is significant professional experience relevant to the proposed area of scholarship. Please do not contact us about waiving the requirement. Instead, use your application materials (your CV, statement of purpose, etc.) to make the case that your professional experience is relevant and should be considered along with your GPA.  Students who completed their degrees outside of Canada should refer to the equivalent academic requirements listed here .      ENGLISH LANGUAGE COMPETENCY  The language of instruction, examination, and communication in the Big Data Professional Master's Program is English. Students whose primary language is not English must meet SFU's English proficiency requirements as set out in the Graduate General Regulation 1.3.12 . Applicants who have completed a degree at a recognized post-secondary institution where the language of instruction and examination is English in a country where English is the primary language are not required to submit proof of English proficiency. Please view the list of accepted countries here .  All other applicants are required to provide proof of English proficiency. For more detailed information on the requirements, please visit the Graduate Studies page on English Language Requirements .      CONDITIONAL & QUALIFYING ADMISSION  The School's Graduate Admissions Committee may, at its discretion, offer admission to the program to exceptional students whose undergraduate degree is not in computer science or a related field. Such students typically make up for the lack of program-specific education through relevant work experience, course work, or certificates, diplomas, etc. The minimum required for conditional or qualifying admission is a demonstrated competence in computer science at a third-year level equivalent to CMPT 300 (Operating Systems I), CMPT 307 (Data Structures and Algorithms), and CMPT 354 (Database Systems I) - see below for course descriptions. Students who receive a qualifying offer take these three courses in the summer semester prior to the start semester of the program. If the courses are completed with a satisfactory average (usually at least B), the qualifying student is admitted into the Professional Master's program in Big Data.     Conditional admission is normally granted to students who are required to take specific graduate courses and achieve a defined grade or grade point average in their first or at the latest, their second term of enrollment in their graduate program.  Qualifying admission is normally granted to students who are required to take specific undergraduate courses and obtain a defined grade or grade point average in order to be considered for admission to the graduate degree program to which they have applied.   For more information on qualifying and conditional admission, please view Graduate Admissions Regulations 1.3.6 and 1.3.8 .

Please read this section carefully before e-mailing us your inquiries. Chances are your most burning questions are adressed below. If anything is unclear or if your questions are not among the frequently asked ones, please contact us at the e-mail address at the bottom of this page.     ABOUT THE PROGRAM  Learn more about the Professional Master's Program in Big Data here .      Do you have a spring intake for the program?      Unfortunately, we do not currently offer a spring intake. Students begin the program in the fall. Applications open in October of each year.     Can I take the program part-time or in the evening?      Currently, we are only offering a full-time program and do not offer evening classes or part-time options.     Which campus houses the program?     The big data program and all its courses are being held at the Burnaby campus.     Who is the target audience for this ""professional"" program?     By ""professional"" we are referring to program graduates who will be looking for jobs in industry once they complete their degree. This is not a research-oriented MSc program. Our recruitment efforts are being focused on students who have sufficient computing science backgrounds with an interest in computational analysis of big data.     What is the tuition fee structure for the big data program?     Please see here .     What is the official name of the program?? What is the name of the degree granted at completion?     The official name of the program is ""Professional Master of Science in Computer Science."" The name of the degree granted is ""Master of Science.""     Will I be assigned a supervisor once I have been accepted into the program?     Please do not approach any SFU Computing Science professors asking them to be your supervisor. This is not a research program, so an academic supervisor is not necessary.     Do students in the big data program qualify for research funding opportunitites?     The program has neither a significant research component, nor any thesis work with research faculty. Therefore, there are no research scholarships available for big data students.     The program structure requires that all students participate in a co-op semester. What if I have already done a graduate co-op semester at SFU?     All students in the program must participate in co-op during the course of their degree, whether they have completed another SFU co-op or not.     ADMISSION  Learn more about admission requirements for the Big Data program here .      Is there a minimum GPA requirement for admission to the program?     We follow the SFU Graduate Regulation 1.3.3 which requires a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.00/4.33 (B), or a grade point average of at least 3.33/4.33 (B+) based on the last 60 credits of undergraduate courses. All graduate work is also considered. In exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted with lower formal qualifications when there is significant professional experience relevant to the proposed area of scholarship. Please do not contact us about waiving the requirement. Instead please use your application materials (your CV, etc.) to make the case that your professional experience is relevant and should be considered along with your GPA.     Is there a minimum English language requirement (TOEFL/IELTS) for admission to the program?     The TOEFL/IELTS minimum scores are explained in this section on English Language Competence by the SFU Dean of Graduate Studies.     I do not think I require a TOEFL or IELTS score. Who do I contact about having this admission requirement waived?     If you have a degree from a recognized instituiton where English is the language of instruction and examination in a country where English is the primary language, you do not need to take a test or apply for an English proficiency waiver. For a list of eligible countries, please click here . If you have a degree from an institution that does not meet this criteria, you can apply for a waiver through the Dean of Graduate Studies (for more information, please see the previous link of eligible countries and scroll to the bottom of the page).     Do I need a GRE or GMAT score to apply?     We do not require a GRE or GMAT score for admission to the program.     When should I arrange to send an official university transcript?? Where should it be sent?     When you apply via our online system, you must upload a digital copy of your transcript (official or unofficial). You should only arrange for submission of your official transcript(s) when you receive an offer of admission.  Transcript(s) can be sent directly to:  BIG DATA - Graduate Admissions Committee   School of Computing Science  8888 University Drive  Burnaby, BC V5A 1S6  Canada     Who makes decisions regarding admission to the program?     Admission decisions are made by the big data program director in consultation with the School's graduate program admissions committee.? Except in unusual circumstances, applications are reviewed by a minimum of two faculty members before final decisons are made.     I have a degree in bioinformatics/economics/statistics/etc. and I do not meet the prerequisite course requirements. What are my options?     Exceptional applicants who do not have a sufficient computer science background may receive a qualifying offer of admission, which requires them to successfully complete up to three prerequisite courses before they are offered full admission into the big data program.      AFTER APPLYING  Learn more about the application process here .      I have ordered my transcripts and they should have arrived at SFU by now. Can you confirm that my transcripts have been received?      Unfortunately, due to the volume of applications we receive, we are unable to confirm receipt of official transcripts to each individual applicant. However, you can check if your transcript was received by logging into the application system and looking at your document checklist. The transcript has a ""Received"" date listed next to it. If the ""Received"" date is after the date you uploaded the document, that means it is the date we received the official transcript in the office. For example, if you uploaded the transcript sometime in October, but the ""received date"" shows November 2nd, then you know we received the tanscript in the office on November 2nd.      I have requested that my official English test score be sent to SFU a while ago. Why has it not been entered into the application system yet?      In order for your test score to be matched with your application in the system, it is important that the name you have provided on both the application and the English test score matches. The same goes for your date of birth. If you think there might have been a mistake or if you have concerns about the timeline, please contact the Graduate Studies Office by opening a ticket at help.deangrad.sfu.ca . Be sure to provide your TRF number or a copy of your test result.  It is important to note that some delays may be due to heavy processing times.     How do I check the status of my application (i.e. to find out what documents have been received)?      To check the status of your application, login at https://go.sfu.ca/paprd/gradapplication.html with your User ID and password and select 'View Application Status' from the Application Services page. Through the Application Services page, you can also update your personal information and review the status of documents that are required for evaluation of your application (eg. test scores, transcripts, references, etc.). The information displayed here is updated as items are received.     If my application status is incomplete, will I still be considered for admission to the program?     Incomplete applications are not reviewed for admission.     OTHER QUESTIONS     I have applied to another graduate program in the School of Computing Science and now want to switch to the big data program. Can I do this?     If you haven't begun your program yet, please contact us about switching programs.  Transfers between programs that are in progress are not possible. If students wish to switch to a different program, they must apply to that program by the admission deadline and wait for an admission offer to be made.     HAVE MORE QUESTIONS?

With every click of a mouse, entry of text, scan of a card, etc., more and more information is being generated all over the world. As data solidifies its role as the currency of the future, Data Science is needed to unlock its value. Simply put, Data Science is the science of data. It is a means of discovering valuable insight from massive stores of data. Data Science is inherently interdisciplinary: a fusion of statistics and computing science, with an underpinning of mathematical principles. Aims of Data Science notably include optimizing operations within an organization, enhancing product/service features, describing trends, evidence-based decision-making, and predicting outcomes.  Some well-known innovations and product/service enhancements that have come from Data Science include:   Autocorrect  Refined Google searches that can filter and customize your search results  Software/websites that make predictions about what type of music you may like (e.g., Spotify) or what books you might like to buy (e.g., Amazon)  Speech recognition products like Siri, Cortana, and Google Voice that allow you to convert spoken word into text  Self-driving cars  Price comparison features on websites to help you shop for the lowest price  The optimization of airline operations by predicting flight delays, route popularity, customer preferences, and parts repairs  Fraud detection   In all of these examples, statistical data analysis and computer programming were used to improve a process/product/service. People who work on accomplishing such feats are referred to as data scientists. Data scientists use the scientific method?make observations, formulate hypotheses, and conduct experiments to test them?to ?liberate and create meaning from raw data? .  Technological advancement has yielded promise of achieving great new heights?e.g., improvements in health care, game-changing innovations and entrepreneurial opportunities, and market optimization. However, recent research in Canada and the United States has highlighted a ? talent gap ??a shortage of trained data scientists. It has been projected that tens of thousands of skilled individuals will be needed in Canada alone to be able to analyze and harvest value from the flood of continually mounting data.      SFU?s Data Science Program     Recognizing the demand for data scientists, SFU has created one of the first undergraduate Data Science programs in Canada. Coursework for the program was carefully chosen to match common skills requested by Canadian data scientist job advertisements, talent shortages described by employers, and skills deemed important for future technologies by leading researchers. While other Data Science programs in North America generally involve coursework in Statistics, Computing Science, and Mathematics only, SFU?s program additionally includes Business coursework, to meet the job demands of business and industry. Our program was designed with recognition that data scientists not only need to be proficient with computer programming and quantitative analysis, but also must be strong communicators with business savvy and teamwork skills.  The Data Science program entails two capstone projects?one at the beginning of the degree and the other towards the end of the degree?to give students the opportunity to analyze and provide solutions for real-world problems.  This BSc program furthermore provides training across a range of sought-after skills and competencies, including:      Software engineering  R  Data acquisition and warehousing  Python  Statistical modeling and analytics  C and C++  Regression  HTML/CSS   Data visualization and presentation   Java  Experimental design and survey sampling  SQL  Mathematical modeling    Critical thinking    Business communication    Marketing    Customer analytics    Project management                     Please see the Academic Calendar for the course and program requirements for Data Science.  Note: Data Science is an undergraduate program at SFU. Students interested in a Master's degree may want to consider SFU's Professional Master's program in Big Data .

Suggested Course Enrollments  With co-op   Without co-op        Frequently Asked Questions     Admission     I am a high school student or potential transfer student from a different post-secondary institution. How can I be admitted into DATA?     Students can apply directly into the Data Science program from high school or as a transfer student. Instructions for how to apply can be found on the Admissions site . For any admissions-related questions, please see the Ask Admissions page .      I am an FIC student, planning to transfer to SFU. How can I get into the DATA program?      Students of Fraser International College are unable to transfer directly into the DATA program at SFU. The pathway program at FIC that is most closely aligned with DATA is the Computing Science pathway, followed by the Business Administration and Engineering Science pathways.  Once at SFU, prospective DATA students need to both meet the criteria for an internal transfer into the Faculty of Science (see the top of this page for the requirements), as well as achieve at least a 2.7 cGPA from key required lower division DATA courses (notably including CMPT 120, Calculus 1, MACM 101, MATH 232/240, and an introductory STAT course) to be admitted into the program.      I am a current student at SFU. How can I declare my major in DATA?     Students already accepted to, or studying at, SFU must consult with the DATA Advisor about being admitted into the program. Admittance is based on completion of key lower division required courses (e.g., MATH 150/151, CMPT 120, MACM 101) with a DATA cGPA of at least 2.7.  Note: If you are currently outside of the Faculty of Science, you will first need to transfer into the faculty before declaring your major (please see the requirements for an internal transfer at the top of this page ).      I have completed an undergraduate degree and am interested in completing DATA as a second degree. How can I apply?     If you are interested in applying to complete DATA as a second undergraduate degree, it is recommended that you first consult with the DATA Advisor . Please also see the ""Second Degree Students"" section below for further details about completing DATA as a second degree.  For those who completed their original degree at SFU :   You can simply apply for reactivation by completing the form on this page . Choose ""Science"" as the faculty when completing the form. If approved by the faculty, you will initially be labelled a ""non-degree student"". Once you have been deemed eligible to do so by the DATA Advisor , you can then declare your major in DATA. Eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis.  For those who completed their original degree elsewhere :  Follow the instructions on this page under the section labelled ""University graduate (degree holder)"". You will need to initially apply as a ""non-degree student"" in the Faculty of Science. When you are admitted, and once you have been deemed eligible to do so by the DATA Advisor , you can then declare your major in DATA. Eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis.     Program and Course Requirements      There is a prerequisite for a BUS course that is not one of the required courses for Data Science. Do I have to take that course?     There are three BUS courses for which some prerequisites will be waived for DATA students:  1. BUS 217W : BUS 201/202 is waived.   2. BUS 445 : BUS 336 is waived.  3. BUS 439 : All prerequisites waived except for BUS 360W and 90 units.      I have already completed CMPT 130 and 135, and so I cannot take CMPT 120, 125, and 127. What should I do?      Consult with the DATA Advisor about this (or any other case in which you have completed a course that you believe is equalivent to a required course). In certain cases, course substitutions can be made.     Do I have the opportunity to take any electives in the Data Science program?     The DATA program is quite structured, with limited room for electives beyond Breadth requirements. The program requirements involve 52-54 lower division units and 43-44 upper division units, which adds up to 95-98 total units.  Of the required coursework, students will meet the university's Writing requirements (both lower and upper division), the Quantitative requirements, the Breadth-Science requirements, and 3 out of 6 units of the Breadth-Social Science requirements. This leaves 3 B-Soc units and 6 B-Hum remaining to meet the WQB requirements . Including these 9 breadth units, DATA students have 13-16 extra required units that they can take as electives, to meet the required 120 overall units, including 44 upper division units. However, note that students are always welcome to take more than 120 units if they would like.     What courses should I complete early on in my degree?     There are certain key courses that it is important to take early on in the degree. Notably these include: MATH 150/151 and MACM 101; CMPT 120, CMPT 125, CMPT 127, and CMPT 225; an introductory Statistics course (BUEC 232/STAT 101/STAT 201/STAT 203/STAT 270); and DATA 180. Please take a look at the lists of Suggested Course Enrollments above.      What is DATA 180/481?     DATA 180 and DATA 481 are a combined class. Students should take DATA 180 towards the beginning of their degree and DATA 481 towards the end.  DATA 180/481 is a one-credit seminar class only offered in Fall semesters. The class takes place once a week for two hours (usually on Tuesday evenings from 6:30-8:30pm). Each week, a different speaker comes in to discuss their area of specialty. Guest speakers can include data scientists (and people working in related roles), past students, and career/co-op advisors.  There are no tests or exams for DATA 180/481. Evaluation is based on completing weekly writing assignments about what the speakers discussed.      What happens if my DATA cGPA drops below 2.7?     There is a continuance requirement of a 2.7 cGPA among required courses in the Data Science program. Each semester your DATA cGPA will be checked. If it drops below 2.7, you will first be issued a warning. If your DATA cGPA drops again the next semester, you may be discontinued from the program.      Second Degree Students     Can I complete the Data Science program as a second undergraduate degree?     Yes, students who have already completed an undergraduate degree can pursue DATA as a second degree.     How can I apply to the Data Science program as a second degree student?      Please see the ""Admission"" section above for details on how to apply as a second degree student.      What is required to complete a BSc in Data Science as a second degree?     Second degree students need to complete: STAT 240 (Introduction to Data Science); all required upper division courses; and any lower division courses that are prerequisites for upper division required courses and that the student does not have equivalent credit for from their first degree. Please see the Course Prerequisites and Course Availability list to see what courses are prerequisites for required upper division courses. Please send the transcript from your first degree to the DATA Advisor to determine which lower division SFU courses for which you can be deemed to have equivalent credit.  A student with an academic background unrelated to Data Science would likely need to take all lower division courses with the exception of the lower division BUS courses (BUS 200, 217W, 251, and 272) and MATH 208W. CMPT 276 would also not be required for such a student, but is strongly recommended.     How will I be able to enroll in a course at SFU that has a prerequisite I completed during my first degree?     If you believe that you have equivalent credit for a course that is a prerequisite for a class you'd like to take at SFU, you will need to email your transcript to the Advisor who oversees that subject area. For example, if you took Calculus 1 in your first degree, and you would like to enroll in MACM 101, you will need to email your transcript to Applied Science Advising ( asadvise@sfu.ca ), requesting permission to enroll in MACM 101. It is recommended that you do this in advance of your enrollment date.

						Admission Requirements                   ADMISSION REQUIREMENTS       Admission to the Professional Master's Program in Big Data is competitive: only the best qualified applicants are offered a seat. Therefore, it is imperative that students familiarize themselves with the admission requirements in order to ensure they submit a strong application. Since conditional and qualifying admission offers are made rarely and only in exceptional cases, students who qualify for regular admission have higher chances of acceptance than those who only qualify for conditional or qualifying admission.     REGULAR ADMISSION   Regular admission is the preferred route for the Professional Master's Program in Big Data. To qualify, students must satisfy the Big Data admission requirements laid out here as well as the University's admission requirements for a master's program, as stated in SFU Graduate Regulation 1.3.3 .  Students must hold a bachelor's degree or equivalent in computer science or a related field with a cumulative grade point average (CGPA) of at least 3.00/4.33 (B), or a grade point average (GPA) of at least 3.33/4.33 (B+) based on the last 60 credits of undergraduate courses. All graduate work is also considered. It is expected that successful applicants have strong programming skills, particularly in languages like Java, Python, and C++. In exceptional circumstances, a student may be admitted with lower formal qualifications when there is significant professional experience relevant to the proposed area of scholarship. Please do not contact us about waiving the requirement. Instead, use your application materials (your CV, statement of purpose, etc.) to make the case that your professional experience is relevant and should be considered along with your GPA.  Students who completed their degrees outside of Canada should refer to the equivalent academic requirements listed here .      ENGLISH LANGUAGE COMPETENCY  The language of instruction, examination, and communication in the Big Data Professional Master's Program is English. Students whose primary language is not English must meet SFU's English proficiency requirements as set out in the Graduate General Regulation 1.3.12 . Applicants who have completed a degree at a recognized post-secondary institution where the language of instruction and examination is English in a country where English is the primary language are not required to submit proof of English proficiency. Please view the list of accepted countries here .  All other applicants are required to provide proof of English proficiency. For more detailed information on the requirements, please visit the Graduate Studies page on English Language Requirements .      CONDITIONAL & QUALIFYING ADMISSION  The School's Graduate Admissions Committee may, at its discretion, offer admission to the program to exceptional students whose undergraduate degree is not in computer science or a related field. Such students typically make up for the lack of program-specific education through relevant work experience, course work, or certificates, diplomas, etc. The minimum required for conditional or qualifying admission is a demonstrated competence in computer science at a third-year level equivalent to CMPT 300 (Operating Systems I), CMPT 307 (Data Structures and Algorithms), and CMPT 354 (Database Systems I) - see below for course descriptions. Students who receive a qualifying offer take these three courses in the summer semester prior to the start semester of the program. If the courses are completed with a satisfactory average (usually at least B), the qualifying student is admitted into the Professional Master's program in Big Data.     Conditional admission is normally granted to students who are required to take specific graduate courses and achieve a defined grade or grade point average in their first or at the latest, their second term of enrollment in their graduate program.  Qualifying admission is normally granted to students who are required to take specific undergraduate courses and obtain a defined grade or grade point average in order to be considered for admission to the graduate degree program to which they have applied.   For more information on qualifying and conditional admission, please view Graduate Admissions Regulations 1.3.6 and 1.3.8 .  Please note: Conditional and qualifying admission are offered only in exceptional circumstances.     Click here to view course descriptions for CMPT 300, 307, and 354.     Operating Systems I  CMPT 300  This course aims to give the student an understanding of what a modern operating system is, and the services it provides. It also discusses some basic issues in operating systems and provides solutions. Topics include multiprogramming, process management, memory management, and file systems.

This wealth of information has led to a need for practitioners who can navigate, interpret and share insights and information for plans, policies and paths of action. Developing skills in this emerging multidisciplinary field has become increasingly relevant for professionals working in?urban planning, real estate, development, transportation, public policy and other related disciplines in the private, government or non-profit sector.       Learn data skills with SFU  Community data science focuses on the collection, analysis and dissemination of data into information and knowledge, with an emphasis on?socio-economic, land-use, economic, real estate and transportation public datasets.  In SFU's new community data science courses, you'll learn best practices for data use. While we will focus on Canadian community data?such as the Census, business licenses and property data?you will also develop skills and a conceptual understanding to analyze and share most structured public datasets.  You'll be able to apply your learning in various ways, depending on your field:   Policy planning: Learn skills to better analyze and develop public policy on housing, economic development, demographics and transportation.  Real estate: Survey major economic, social and land use databases that will help your understanding of what shapes real estate demand and supply.  Journalism: Learn how to mine various key national and local datasets to build and strengthen your stories.  Non-profit organization: Develop and share better insights about your service population and community needs.      Community Data Science Courses               SFU's City Program is exploring the possibility of offering a Community Data Science program. As a first step, we are introducing a suite of pilot courses that focus on developing the initial theory and skills foundations needed to successfully transform data into information and knowledge. Classes will be small, learner-centred, and with an emphasis on real-world applications.  We are hoping this proposed program will eventually be approved by the SFU Senate as a certificate. Should we receive approval, we then hope to be able to give students who complete the following courses partial credit toward the certificate.      There are no courses in this program open for registration at this time.  Please check back later for updates.

Congruent with the search for and application of sound psychological principles is the metaphor of teacher as researcher. This course will enable beginning graduate students to intelligently read and critically evaluate published scholarly research by becoming familiar with parametric statistical constructs, measures of certain tendency, variability, and measures of relationship.

The days of the closed-door classroom are over. Now, learning stretches beyond the traditional lecture theatre, which in turn eliminates barriers and generates opportunities for more open (and equal) education.  By taking students into the field, even when they?re sitting on the bus or waiting for a plane, UBC is making research and science more accessible than ever. Students can access new knowledge independently, making it possible to learn on their own terms in and out of the classroom.  Student schedules are demanding, making it tough to get a whole class out for a weekend field trip but UBC Geography has engineered a workaround that fits everyone?s schedule. If students can?t attend a given field trip, they can head out into the field another time and the ?lesson? will still be waiting for them to experience. The rich and interesting topography along the Sea-to-Sky route that connects Vancouver and Whistler, for instance, makes it an ideal outdoor classroom for geography students to explore.  At designated points along this geographically rich corridor ? such as the Cleveland Dam, the Stawamus Chief and the Britannia Mine ? students can hop out of the car, whip out their smartphones and experience a virtual field trip through a 360-degree photosphere ? sometimes even more than one at a time ? all without their instructor being there. Hosted on FieldPress, the photospheres give learners a 360-degree view of the area, adding to their own on-the-ground experience by allowing them to pan back or zoom in on certain features, or see them under different seasonal and weather conditions. Visually rich and accompanied by relevant audio, each photosphere includes pop-up information bytes, additional images, and links to videos and quiz questions so instructors can ensure students are completing the course requirements.         Explore a 360-degree image of the Sea-to-Sky region??.           play      Explore a 360-degree image of the Sea-to-Sky region??.                Engaging, accessible and wholly flexible, the virtual field trips take away the time crunch, making out-of-the-classroom learning convenient and fun.  Imagine strapping on a viewfinder, taking up two hand controllers ? and finding yourself standing right in front of Stanley Park?s legendary Hollow Tree. A raven swoops past, its raucous caws making you jump. Aim your controller at the bird and it lights up: there?s information here. You click, and a clear voice explains the ecological connection between these birds and the surrounding western red cedars.  Turn your attention back to the Hollow Tree and your learning takes a different direction as you browse the options screen that pops up in mid-air. Go ahead, dig deeper. Walk around the tree. Examine it close up, now step back and take the long view. What was this place like 1,000 years ago, when the Hollow Tree was just a sapling? You?ll go straight there with a click of the controller. Suddenly you?re immersed in the sights and sounds of the land on which and from where the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-WaututhFirst Nations once lived, fished, and buried their ancestors.  Among global post-secondary institutions, UBC is at the fore in using virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology to augment its teaching.

For us, it?s about getting students into the field and applying and experiencing what they?re learning in class to the real world.      ?For us, it?s about getting students into the field and applying and experiencing what they?re learning in class to the real world,? says UBC geography instructor Loch Brown, whose team is busy creating augmented and virtual reality experiences of places such as Stanley Park, UBC?s Vancouver and Okanagan campuses and the Sea-to-Sky corridor. ?We want students to see what we?re talking about so the learning becomes embedded.?  The augmented reality field trips ? whether in the form of a 360-degree photosphere, a 360-degree video viewed through a VR headset, or a full VR/AR experience ? allow much more flexibility for geography students to head out into the field when it?s convenient for them. ?All the architecture of how we?re designing it is so students can access the field trip through their mobile phone and do it when it fits into their schedule,? says Brown. ?And like all open learning at UBC, it?s for everyone. Anybody around the world can put on their headset and take the UBC tour of Stanley Park.?         Explore a 360-degree image of Granville Island??.           play      Explore a 360-degree image of Granville Island.                 Whether it?s a self-paced field trip accessible through a smartphone or an immersive virtual reality experience that crosses time and space, the new shape of information delivery is flexible, multisensory and interactive ? and gives students the opportunity to curate their own educational experiences. It?s just the start of 360-degree learning at UBC.    Explore the future of learning               UBC Geography Department  The Geography undergraduate program is divided into three fields: physical, human, and technical.

Engineering undergrad Ryan Hirakida thought he was going to Japan for an international co-op work term. But the experience was richer than that: he learned a new language and a totally different work ethic. He learned to think critically ? about everything. His empathy broadened and he returned home with a changed view of how we do business back in Canada.  As a third-year engineering student, Ryan understood the value of a co-op experience. He knew it would help get his feet under him and give him some chops in the engineering world. But securing a co-op placement isn?t a guarantee ? it?s a competitive process for students, as companies often cross-post jobs at multiple universities.  So Ryan pivoted and took a more targeted approach. He?d never considered working abroad before. But when he became aware of The Canada-Japan Co-op Program facilitated by the Engineering Co-op Program, he realized it was a perfect match. From his experiences exploring different places within Canada, he knew about the life-changing power of travel. As a fourth-generation Japanese-Canadian, he also knew there was a lot he didn?t know about his ancestral country, its language and its way of life.  ?I figured if I throw myself into a situation where I?ve never done anything like it before, I?d definitely walk out with a new perspective,? says Ryan. ?I wanted to see a new way of living and go through my day-to-day life in a way that would give me a new lens on things when I returned.?       I wanted to see a new way of living and go through my day-to-day life in a way that would give me a new lens on things when I returned.      1/9 Local summer festival in Tokyo  2/9 Mt.

Through the UBC Engineering Co-op Program , and specifically The Canada-Japan Co-op Program, Ryan had secured a placement with Dai Nippon Printing (DNP), a leading printing and information technology company. Once he had the job, The Canada-Japan Co-op Program team helped steer him with visas and travel documentation assistance, and put him through an intensive training week where he learned about etiquette, business culture and what to expect while living in Japan.  ?It was really helpful,? says Ryan. ?The Canada-Japan Co-op Program has a dedicated advisor, Yuko Nemoto, who works with the students in Japan ? and it?s not a really huge pool of people,? he says. ?She knows you personally, and she wants you to succeed.? Ryan felt more empowered knowing that help was just a phone call away.  Ryan went to work, exercising his technical skills in data analysis, experimental design and product development. He even tried his hand at designing a plastic bottle from the ground up. And he did it all while being immersed in a totally different way of doing business. ?There was this attitude of group-mindedness,? Ryan recalls. ?It?s not always about trying to advance yourself so that you can be the best that you can be.?       The Canada-Japan Co-op Program has a dedicated advisor, Yuko Nemoto, who works with the students in Japan ? and it?s not a really huge pool of people [?] She knows you personally, and she wants you to succeed.                   Wearing the steel-toed boots, blue shirt and pants reminded him of the goals he and his fellow coworkers all shared. Scheduled workplace cleaning times where everyone, regardless of position, swept the floors, took out the garbage and organized supplies reinforced the value of shared responsibility.  The learning was a two-way experience for Ryan. While navigating the language and absorbing a more team-oriented way of working as he cycled through different departments and assisted with projects, he was also sharing his own knowledge and background as a Canadian. Although he didn?t know it at the time, DNP had brought him on staff to be a teacher just as much as he was a learner. Always forward-thinking, the company understood the value of introducing its employees to someone from a distinctly different culture, and of having the group muddle through conversations and interactions together so that all parties could arrive at a better understanding of each other?s perspectives.  It was a daily thing, this butting up against the language barrier, whether Ryan was figuring out table manners or conducting microbial analysis or organizing a weekend snowboarding trip. While at times it was more expeditious at work to use English, Ryan sought every opportunity to work on his second language.  ?Working in a non-English speaking country gave me a deeper understanding of how communication preferences can differ,? says Ryan, who was named The Canada-Japan Co-op Program Student of the Year for 2015-2016. ?Now I feel more attuned to the communication styles of other people, and also have a better understanding of how to cater to these differences. I?ve developed more empathy for people who want to communicate their ideas but have to do it in a second language. I can relate to it!?  As a result of his co-op experience in Japan, Ryan?s view of his engineering degree is much broader: ?It opened my eyes to aspects of international business and the importance of effective cross-cultural communication. I'd love to have a career in the future that would give me international opportunities to build on the communication skills that I developed in Japan.?  There?s an enormous breadth of variety in the programs UBC offers its students to gain tangible real-world experience.

Meet just a few of our international graduate scholars whose research inspires and influences new thinking around the world.   ?Our graduate students come to UBC from over 100 countries around the world. These students' graduate work may be anchored here at UBC, but their educational experiences, influence and networks truly span the globe.? Dr. Jenny Phelps, Assistant Dean, Student Administration and Strategic Initiatives  ?We are grateful and very proud that UBC has attracted outstanding graduate students from around the world. These individuals not only play critical roles in creating new knowledge that benefits our world, but they contribute immeasurably to the richness and diversity of our own intellectual community at UBC.? Dr. Susan Porter, Dean and Vice-Provost, UBC Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies         AJung       Nathan         Jacqueline       Ehsan         Toufiqul       Juliana         Kathi       Julian         Sophie       Dada         Nilufar       Yuanshen                                                            AJung Moon   Faculty: Applied Science  Country: Korea, South  State/Province: Gyeongsangnam-do  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in Mechanical Engineering (PhD)  Started program at UBC in: 2012  Research topic: Human Robot Interaction and Roboethics    I hope to contribute to the field of human-robot interaction and roboethics (study of ethical, legal, and societal issues pertaining to robotics) by introducing a new paradigm of interaction that allows flexible, shared decision making.?  Read More    About AJung's Research People share spaces and objects with each other every day. When conflicts regarding access to these shared resources occur, people communicate with each other to negotiate a solution. But what should a robot do when such conflicts occur between a human and a robotic assistant? Answers to this question depend on the context of the situation. In order for robots to be successfully deployed in homes and workplaces, it is important for robots to be equipped with the ability to make socially and morally acceptable decisions about the conflict at hand. However, robots today are not very good at making such decisions. The objective of my research is to investigate an interactive paradigm of human-robot conflict resolution that does not involve complicated, artificial moral decision making. I am currently working on a robotic system that can communicatively negotiate about resource conflicts with its human partner using nonverbal gestures.  Why UBC? While I was pursuing my master's degree at UBC, I started an international organization called the Open Roboethics initiative (ORi) that aims to raise public awareness of roboethics issues (i.e. ethical, societal, and legal issues pertaining to robotics technology) and to better incorporate stakeholder discussions into design. I've decided to stay at UBC for my PhD in order to continue to work with the world-class roboethics experts and roboticists who helped start the organization.             Nathan Furey   Faculty: Faculty of Forestry  Country: USA  State/Province: New York  Home town: Smyrna  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in Forestry (PhD)  Research topic: Quantitative analysis and simulation of salmon smolt migrations    Not to sound too clich?, but with graduate school, you really get out of the experience what you put in. Don't be afraid to aim big, but also keep in mind that your ultimate goal is to learn and be a better scientist.?  Read More    About Nathan's Research Salmon are of great economic value to Canada and many other nations. These diadromous species spawn in freshwater, where juveniles rear for up to three years prior to becoming ""smolts"". Smolts then migrate to the ocean where they stay for up to three years prior to returning as adults to spawn in freshwater. Although migrations of thousands of individuals have been tracked using acoustic telemetry, we know little as to the factors impacting smolt migration success. To investigate factors influencing smolt migration survival, quantitative models will be developed. First, existing telemetry data will be combined with geospatial information regarding climate and environmental conditions to develop empirical models relating migration survival to experienced hydrology and oceanography. Secondly, a large-scale individual-based model (IBM) will be developed to simulate smolt migrations to better understand movement behaviours of smolts, as well as to understand the potential impacts of various climate change scenarios.  Why UBC? What drew me in to UBC were the incredible opportunities in terms of types of research, data, and networking or collaborative opportunities. I simply felt that coming into the research group would provide the optimal environment to be successful in terms of obtaining skills, conducting high-quality research that can advance scientific knowledge, and meeting and working with other experts that can not only help my graduate research but also assist in moving my career forward.             Jacqueline Davis   Faculty: Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies  Country: United States  Home town: Temple  State/Province: New Hampshire  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in Interdisciplinary Studies (PhD)  Started program at UBC in: 2012  Research topic: Youth development through circus-based physical activity    Living in Vancouver is a huge part of my UBC experience. I find the physical beauty of this place utterly inspiring ? I feel limitless personal potential looking out on the mountains or across the waters, or walking amid the huge, stately trees that have played such an important role in indigenous cultural life here.?  Read More    About Jacqueline's Research My research interests lie in exploring the relationship between circus-based physical activities and positive youth outcomes. I hypothesize that youth circus activities markedly benefit physical, social, emotional, and cognitive development in young people. Using self-determination theory as a lens, I am designing a stratified, randomized control trial with pre and post-intervention assessment to compare children in an afterschool circus program, sport program, and no program to measure participants' physical fitness, executive functions, social/emotional competency, psychological need satisfaction, and motivation. Evidence from this study could point to a new paradigm for positive development for youth of all ages and abilities.  Why UBC? In a way, UBC chose me. While I was at Harvard I had my first conversation with my future UBC advisor who invited me to do a PhD with her ? I had not even thought of that yet. I filed that in the back of my mind and searched for a doctoral program closer to home. Nothing met my needs. UBC's Interdisciplinary Studies Graduate Program is a perfect fit ? there's nothing like it in the United States.              Ehsan Mohammadi Zahrani   Faculty: Faculty of Applied Science  Country: Iran  Home town: Esfahan  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in Materials Engineering (PhD)  Started program at UBC in: 2009  Research topic: Electrochemical Behavior and Corrosion Properties of Advance Materials    UBC offers an excellent environment for academic and social growth to the student. Therefore, I firmly believe that it is crucial for students to try making contributions not only in academic research work, but also in social and extracurricular activities at this university, in order to grow their leadership ability.?  Read More    About Ehsan's Research My research has been mainly focused on electrochemical behavior and corrosion properties of advanced materials for hard tissue human body implants and drug delivery applications.  Why UBC? I had several opportunities around the world to continue my study toward a PhD, but I selected UBC as my final destination since the Corrosion Research Group of the Materials Engineering Department, led by professor Alfantazi, is one of the most prestigious and leading research groups in the world in the area of corrosion. It has been my golden opportunity to be able to find an outstanding professor in this world-class leading research group to support me in doing research in the area of my interest.             Toufiqul Islam   Faculty: Faculty of Applied Science  Country: Bangladesh  Home town: Dhaka  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in Electrical and Computer Engineering (PhD)    The communications research scope in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UBC is among the world's best.?  Read More    About Toufiqul's Research My research focus is on design and analysis of cooperative diversity in wireless networks. Cooperative diversity systems employ relays to increase data rate and reliability of wireless networks. Cooperative diversity schemes have tremendous potential to be considered for next generation broadband wireless communication systems.  On Graduate Life Well, I find grad life challenging as well as interesting. During the course of my study, I have met students of different races and cultures which is a unique experience. The spectacular UBC campus, calm blue ocean beside, view of snow-capped nearby mountains refresh my mind whenever I find myself overloaded with my grad studies.              Juliana Negreiros   Faculty: Faculty of Education  Country: Brazil  Home town: Sao Paulo  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in School Psychology (PhD)  Started program at UBC in: 2007  Research topic: Pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder    UBC Grad School? Be ready to study very hard and to challenge yourself. Studying abroad is not easy, but it has been the best learning experience that I have ever had.?  Read More    About Juliana's Research I am interested in investigating potential neuropsychological and cognitive dysfunctions in children with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and to gain a better understanding about the heritability of cognitive and neuropsychological traits in OCD. Having more evidence about the neuropsychological and cognitive profile of children with OCD may enhance our understanding about specific processes associated with the disorder, as well as increase treatment effectiveness, including improvements in OCD severity and individual and family overall functioning.  Why UBC? I chose to live in BC because of the climate and beautiful nature, and I decided to study at UBC because of the richness of the School Psychology program.             Kathi Unglert   Faculty: Faculty of Science  Country: Germany  Home town: Landsberg am Lech  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in Geophysics (PhD)  Started program at UBC in: 2011  Research topic: Using Volcanic Tremor as a Tool for Eruption Forecasting    The best surprise were all the opportunities to get involved at UBC and in Vancouver. I really enjoy science outreach and love the fact that I can promote Earth Sciences in the Pacific Museum of the Earth or through Let's Talk Science.?  Read More    About Kathi's Research Volcanic tremor is a type of earthquake that occurs on volcanoes around the world. The source mechanism of this type of earthquake is potentially linked to moving magma or hydrothermal fluids, and its occurrence is often interpreted as an eruption precursor. However, the exact source mechanism behind volcanic tremor remains under debate. I examine time series of volcano monitoring data (e.g. GPS measurements, seismograms) to characterize volcanic tremor on selected volcanoes in Hawaii, Alaska, Central/South American and Europe. I use classical time series analysis and machine learning to identify global patterns in volcanic tremor.  Why UBC? UBC is great for Earth Sciences. My group here has a broad range of research interests and thinking outside of the box is encouraged. My supervisor's focus is fluid mechanics, a field that I previously knew nothing about. I loved the challenge that comes with this new research field, and the fact that I can combine it with seismology and geodesy, the research areas I am familiar with.             Julian Yates   Faculty: Faculty of Arts  Country: United Kingdom  Home town: Rugby  State/Proince: Warwickshire  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in Geography (PhD)  Started program at UBC in: 2010  Research topic: Diverse livelihoods and new institutional arrangements in the Peruvian Andes    A graduate degree offers not only freedom of research, but also the chance to tackle the most important issues that face contemporary society.?  Read More    About Julian's Research The aim of my doctoral research is to advance understanding of the dynamic nature of livelihood institutions (understood as systems of rules pertaining to human and non-human actors) in the Peruvian Andes. In what ways do institutions emerge and re-emerge to facilitate the adaptation of Andean socio-natural livelihoods to shifting structural and biophysical contexts (such as political economic change, changing governance mechanisms, and climate change)? My research will contribute to a more thorough empirical and theoretical understanding of whether a particular ""Andean way"" ( Andinidad ) plays a role in the co-constitution of diverse socio-natural livelihoods. I explore this notion of Andinidad via the case of the kamayoq , who are indigenous, community-based ?specialists? within programmes farmer-to-farmer agricultural extension (extending agricultural techniques via peer-to-peer communication methods), which are implemented largely by non-governmental organisations (NGOs).   Why UBC? UBC's geography department is consistently ranked among the best in the world. My supervisor, Dr. Karen Bakker, is an expert on issues of water governance in Canada, the UK, and beyond. She was recently promoted to the Canada Chair position for Political Ecology, and was featured in the Globe and Mail's ""top 40 under 40"".             Sophie Webber   Faculty: Faculty of Arts  Country: Australia  Home town: Melbourne  State/Province: Victoria  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in Geography (PhD)    I decided to pursue a graduate degree because I love learning, thinking, and discovering. I am also passionate about, and endlessly intrigued by, both my discipline and my specific research. Graduate study was a wonderful way to keep exploring.?  Read More    About Sophie's Research My research aims to determine how the climate change adaptation 'industry' ? an assemblage of government, consulting, scientists, global agencies, and international financiers and donors ? establishes itself, how it operates, and what some of the political-economic effects of the industry are. I look to key sites of the industry: Pacific Islands where experiments in climate change adaptation are rife, and the World Bank offices in Sydney. In these sites, I will examine the new Green Climate Fund, a UNFCCC institution that aims to disperse US$100 billion annually for climate initiatives through the World Bank. Specifically, I will ask four key questions: (i) what mobile ideas, expertise and truth claims sustain the ecology of climate change adaptation projects, and how; (ii) how are expertise and finance co-constituted; (iii) how does 'successful' climate change adaptation travel and embed itself locally; and (iv) what are the effects of these projects?  Why UBC? The Geography graduate program at UBC is fantastic: huge, vibrant, exciting, and intellectually stimulating. I wanted to leave Australia to study for many reasons, but I was extremely lucky to end up here.             Dada Docot   Faculty: Faculty of Arts  Country: Philippines  Research topic: Filipino migration to Japan    There are so many resources within UBC of which students can take advantage. For example The Liu Institute for Global Issues has made possible the creation of the Philippine Studies Series, a group which aims to bring to UBC the discussion of Philippine-related issues. Through the Philippine Studies Series I have met many wonderful individuals who share my interests.?  Read More    About Dada's Research My research will focus on the study of Filipino women who now reside in Japan. It will reflect on migration patterns in both the Philippines and Japan, looking to reveal the shifts in what was previously predominantly an America-bound emigration pattern. I intend to particularly focus on migrants hailing from my hometown in the Philippines and to understand the intricacies of their life through the lenses of feminization of work, national and global policy, the idealization of migration in everyday life, etc. This research is a continuation of my long-time interest in the study of Filipino women in Japan, and of the filming of the everyday life of Filipinos engaged in international migration.  Why UBC? The Ethnographic Film Unit that is hosted by our Department, the very strong Japanese Studies program at the Asian Center, and of course, the opportunity to work with my research supervisor, all encouraged me to come to UBC. I had also heard many positive things about the Department of Anthropology at UBC ? for one, that it is located just beside the world-famous Museum of Anthropology.             Nilufar Islam   Faculty: Faculty of Applied Science, School of Engineering, UBC Okanagan  Country: Bangladesh  Home town: Rajshahi  Research topic: The impact of disinfection byproducts (DBPs) on the safety of water distribution networks    Winning the Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) will help me continue my research into methods to improve water distribution networks. I want to find a way to ensure all households, especially those in small communities, receive safe drinking water.?The award will help me achieve that goal.?    About Nilufar's Research Chlorination is needed to keep drinking water safe. But once it is chlorinated, naturally-occurring organic materials in the water react with the chlorine and produce chemicals called disinfection byproducts (DBPs). High levels of DBPs in drinking water have been associated with health risks such as cancer and reproductive disorders. Finding the correct balance between microbial and chemical water quality is essential, and quite often water quality diminishes the further it gets from the chlorination source. Essentially, while a house near a water supply may have the correct amount of chlorine, a house further away ? where water travels a greater distance in pipelines ? might need more. But if more chlorine is added to the main water supply, the DBPs may become dangerously high for homes closest to the water supply. I?m investigating booster chlorination at specific places along the water supply route, which may improve water quality.  Why UBC Okanagan? Initially I applied to UBC for my Master of Applied Science because of the university?s high rankings.?I accepted and chose UBC?s Okanagan campus for my PhD because of the quality and level of interaction I?m able to have with my research supervisors. From my first interaction with the School of Engineering, through to my research today, faculty members provided the guidance and support I need to further my academic career.?I meet with Dr. Sadiq almost each week for guidance on my research.?Under his advice I?ve attended conferences, joined networks, applied for, and received awards including the Alexander Graham Bell Canada Graduate Scholarship grant from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC).             Yuanshen Huang   Faculty: Faculty of Medicine  Country: China  Home town: Beihai  State/Province: Guangxi  Started program at UBC in: 2010  Program: Doctor of Philosophy in Experimental Medicine (PhD)  Research topic: The role of the TOX molecule in the development of skin lymphomas    I was pleasantly surprised that every bit of the academic excellence and natural beauty of UBC that I heard about actually turned out to be true! In addition, the cultural diversity made me feel right at home.?  Read More    About Yuanshen's Research Our lab studies how cancer-specific genes cause the malignant behaviors of skin cancers such as skin lymphomas and melanomas. The ultimate goal is to use these molecules to develop better diagnostic methods and more effective therapies for these cancers. In particular, my project is centered on a molecule called TOX (thymocyte selection associated high mobility box) that we found to be abnormally switched on in the skin lymphoma cells. By turning off TOX in my experiments, markedly decreased growth rate and accelerated speed of cell death of the lymphoma cells were observed, suggesting that TOX plays a critical role in the development of skin lymphomas.  Why UBC? UBC is a natural choice for me for many reasons. There are two most important reasons: first, UBC has a rich tradition and an outstanding reputation as a leader in biomedical research; second, Dr. Youwen Zhou presented a research talk on skin lymphomas in Peking University where I was studying clinical dermatology. As a result, I became interested in skin lymphoma research and decided to become a graduate student in his laboratory at UBC.

The work of computer scientist Margaret-Anne (Peggy) Storey?who studies how technologies can help us understand and share complex information?has led to software improvement in many areas, including education, security analytics and medicine. Aerospace engineer Afzal Suleman uses advanced computational tools to develop more environmentally and economically efficient aircraft, while improving public safety. Physicist Randy Sobie leads an international project to globally share massive volumes of data from one of the world's largest physics experiments. George Tzanetakis blends signal processing, machine learning, music perception and human-computer interfaces to develop more effective tools for manipulating large audio collections. previous next Making sense of complexity  As our ability to gather information about the world and our lives grows, we need better tools to make sense of it all. Powerful computer systems offer new ways for researchers to organize data, find patterns and predict changes.  Data science enables our researchers to explore massively complex systems?such as climate change, ocean physics, galactic evolution, and the fleeting existence of new types of matter during high-energy collisions of subatomic particles.  UVic expertise in cyber physical systems includes advanced computing, networked control systems, energy systems, ?smart oceans? technology, biostatistics, and assistive technologies and medical care monitoring.

Students Faculty, advisers & secretaries Alumni & donors       home finances tuition & fees  Tuition and fees We want your academic work to challenge you, not your finances. Fortunately, graduate students at UVic benefit from modest tuition fees and a range of funding supports. These pages are designed to highlight some of the costs associated with graduate studies at UVic and to streamline your financial planning. Quick links   Current tuition and fees schedule  T uition and fees overview  FAQs  Contacts  Graduate student tuition income offset plan and form  Application fees and acceptance deposits Application fees  Your application for admission cannot be processed until your application fee is received.?You will be prompted to pay this fee by credit card as part of the online application process.  Application fees for graduate students are published in the graduate academic calendar :   Domestic application fee - all transcripts arriving from institutions within Canada  International application fee - any transcripts arriving from institutions outside of Canada   These fees are non-refundable and will not be counted toward your tuition.  Acceptance deposits  Some academic units may require payment of an acceptance deposit. This deposit is non-refundable, but will be credited to your first term fees upon registration. Please contact the graduate secretary for your program to see if this applies to you. Tuition fees and payments  About graduate tuition at UVic  For degree students at the graduate level, tuition is assessed as a total degree program fee, not as a per course fee. Payment of the fee is broken down into ?fee installments.? You will be charged an installment for every term you are registered in a degree program. Fees are assessed in September, January and May.  Please note that minimum fee installments apply, regardless of your degree level or program timeline. For full details, consult the Regulations Concerning Tuition Fees for Graduate Programs .  Current fees   For current fees, see the t uition and fees schedule . You will be assessed domestic fees if you are a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. International fees will be assessed if you are studying on a student visa.  In addition to tuition, you are required to pay other (ancillary) fees as part of student life at UVic and must arrange for appropriate medical insurance .  If you are studying at UVic as a non-degree student, you will pay for individual courses on a per-unit basis.   Please note:   Students enrolled in the graduate co-op program will pay a work term fee in addition to program and other student fees.  Students who remain registered after exceeding the time limit for their degree (normally five years for a master's degree and seven years for a doctoral degree) will be assessed a program extension fee at the regular tuition rate per term.   Tuition and Fees FAQs  Graduate Student Tuition Income Offset Plan  You have the option of participating in a Tuition Income Offset Plan to assist you in aligning the payment of your tuition with your award and/or employment income.? The plan allows you to pay tuition in four instalments over each four-month term and have the payments taken automatically from your bank account.  Full details, deadlines and the authorization form are available from Accounting Services .  Completion Postponement Fee Adjustment (CPFA)  Students who have defended their project, thesis or dissertation within the first 15 days of a term may be eligible for the Completion Postponement Fee Adjustment ($250) in lieu of a full tuition fee payment.  To be eligible, students must be registered in the term in which the defense takes place, and have paid their minimum program fee instalments prior to that term. Final documents must be received in GARO by the final business day of the month.  Students making use of the CPFA will not be eligible for graduation in the term in which they defend. Students completing under the provisions of the CPFA in September or January will graduate in the spring, and students completing under CPFA in May will graduate in the fall. Student (ancillary) fees As part of student life at UVic, all students are required to pay some universal (ancillary) fees in addition to their tuition. A list of ancillary fees is published in the graduate academic calendar .  See the Graduate Students? Society for information on opting out of the extended health or dental plans .  Consult the Graduate Students? Society for the very limited conditions for opting out of the U-Pass bus pass plan . Medical insurance All students are required to have appropriate health insurance for the duration of their studies in Canada. The Graduate Students? Society (GSS) provides a mandatory extended health plan and dental insurance plan (in addition to regular MSP coverage) for full-time graduate students. See the Graduate Students? Society for information on health plan and dental coverage .  Aon Reed Stenhouse Inc. (Aon) is UVic?s approved emergency medical insurance provider for the waiting period. You can enrol for these services online. The extended health insurance included in your student fees is not a substitute for emergency health insurance or BC MSP.  International students : for more information on medical insurance requirements for international students, visit the International and Exchange Student Services website .  BC residents (including international students): you must be covered by BC Medical Services Plan (MSP). There is a waiting period for new applicants, so you should arrange for emergency health insurance from an alternate provider before you arrive in BC.  Residents of another Canadian province : you may choose to stay with your home province medical plan. Please contact your provincial medical plan office for details: contact information is listed on the GSS website. Other costs and budgeting In addition to program and ancillary fees, financial considerations such as where and how you will live while you study and additional expenses including transportation, technology, travel, books and food all have to be factored in.

Each category is subdivided into areas that represent a range of the fields of computer science, as given in the table below:     Systems  Theory  Applications    Software engineering  Design and analysis of Algorithms  Databases    Programming languages  Scientific computing  Artificial intelligence    Hardware and software systems  Complexity theory  Bioinformatics    Networks and distributed systems  Logic and discrete mathematics  Graphics and user interfaces     Areas not listed above may be acceptable if documented and approved by the supervisory committee. It is up to the student to justify which category the course should be classified in and its value to the academic program. For example, the area of ?Databases? might fit within the ?Applications? category, or it may be considered as an area in either the ?Theory? or ?Systems? category, depending on the academic content being evaluated.  The supervisory committee is responsible for checking that the breadth requirement is satisfied correctly according to the expectations and to any variations. Explicit notes must be included about the breadth requirement at every progress report.  Breadth Requirements?Template MSc course registration The executive summary: you are expected to have continuous registration. The exception is if you are requesting a leave of absence or withdrawal with permission.  To be in full time status, you must be registered for at least 3.0 units each term. IF you happen to be taking only one course in a particular term, then you should also register in the thesis or project (CSC 599 or 598) in order to maintain your full time status.  To learn how to register in coursework, visit:  Student Registration Tutorial  Not all courses are available for online registration! A MSc student may opt to enroll in 4xx level CSC courses or in a course outside of the department as part of the program (e.g. a MATH course or even a SENG course is seen as ""not CSC""). For this type of registration, you cannot register online and *must* instead complete the Graduate Course Change form. The steps are as follows:   Download the Graduate Course Change form from the Graduate Studies website  Complete your part of the form.  Have the form signed by the course instructor (email approval can be attached to the form).  Have the form signed by your supervisor who must include a brief comment as to why this course will be beneficial for your graduate degree.  The form will then be submitted to Graduate Admissions & Records for manual input.   To audit a course as a continuing graduate student:? add the audit course by completing a Graduate Course Change form available from the Graduate Studies website . MSc examining committee For the MSc Thesis Option ,? the final oral examining is composed of the supervisory committee and one other external examiner who has had no previous involvement with graduate supervision? of the candidate. Such an examiner is recommended to graduate studies in consultation between the student and the supervisor. The final oral examining committee must include at least one person from outside the Department of Computer Science. Thus if the supervisory committee already includes a member from outside the Department of Computer Science, the examiner can be a member of the department. A chair of the oral examination committee is appointed by the Faculty of Graduate Studies.  For the MSc Project Option , the final oral examining committee is composed of the supervisory committee plus a chair who is normally a member of the Department of Computer Science. MSc annual progress report The purpose of the annual progress report is to support your?successful progress?through the MSc?program. The annual progress report is a constructive tool that reviews your?accomplishments over a?12-month period to help you?move forward in your program successfully. Your achievements are?acknowledged,?possible impediments are examined,?and actions to overcome any impediments are determined?and?agreed upon. The annual progress report must be compiled and submitted at least once in every 12 month period of a graduate program. The expected submission date is August 1 of each year. Failure to submit a progress report may result in you?being unable to register?the following term and?reported by your graduate advisor to the chair of the department.  Your?supervisor is responsible for providing regular reports to evaluate progress in the graduate program. The annual progress report is a requirement of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and cannot be waived by any department. However, its administration is determined by individual departments.? Please refer to our Graduate resources page for the annual progress report form for?directions on?how to submit your?report. MSc thesis option MSc project option MSc industrial option Thesis and oral examination  The Faculty of Graduate Studies states the following guidelines regarding an acceptable thesis for a successful MSc program:   The thesis must demonstrate that a student understands and is capable to employ research methods and has command of the subject.  If the work is based on data, the data may be new data or provided by others.  The thesis should show evidence of perspective on the topic and show that appropriate methodology has been understood and applied.  The thesis should include a general overview of relevant literature and show that the student is capable of writing a well-organized professional technical document.  The thesis must provide evidence of some new contribution to the field of existing knowledge or a new perspective on existing knowledge.   The student will give an oral examination of the thesis in accordance with the departmental and university regulations.? Upon successful completion of the oral examination and all other departmental and university requirements, the student will be awarded the degree of Master of Science.  Finishing your degree? See degree completion of tasks to complete leading up to your oral exam.  Thesis option program length  The normal expectation is to complete the program in five terms (20 months). Students enrolled in a co-operative education program will have additional months added to the normal completion times equal to the time spent on co-op work terms. In all cases, the department expects students to complete their Master's degree within the maximum time limits set by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The minimum regular program fee for a master's degree is five tuition installments which can consist of a combination of regular full and regular half tuition installments. One additional regular tuition installment will be assessed if a student remains registered after having paid five regular full tuition installments (for a total regular tuition of six). Project and oral examination  The Faculty of Graduate Studies does not have at the present precise guidelines regarding an acceptable project for a successful MSc program. It is understood however that a project is smaller than a thesis both in scope and implementation. The following points remain in common with the expectations for a thesis, albeit on a smaller scale:   The project must demonstrate that a student understands and is capable to employ research methods and has command of the subject.  If the work is based on data, the data may be new data or provided by others.  The project should show evidence of perspective on the topic and show that appropriate methodology has been understood and applied.  The project report should show that the student is capable of writing a professional technical document.   Finishing your degree? See degree completion of tasks to complete leading up to your oral exam.  Project option program length  The normal expectation is to complete the program in five terms (20 months). Students enrolled in a co-operative education program will have additional months added to the normal completion times equal to the time spent on co-op work terms. In all cases, the department expects students to complete their Master's degree within the maximum time limits set by the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The minimum regular program fee for a master's degree is five tuition installments which can consist of a combination of regular full and regular half tuition installments. One additional regular tuition installment will be assessed if a student remains registered after having paid five regular full tuition installments (for a total regular tuition of six). Industrial project and non-thesis oral examination  A student who chooses the industrial option will also have a non-thesis oral examination. The amount of work required to complete the project should be equivalent to one, 1.5 unit course.  Finishing your degree?? See degree completion of tasks to complete leading up to your oral exam.  Industrial option program length  The normal expectation is to complete the program typically in four to five terms?by completing two or three CSC graduate?courses per term.?Students may also enroll in additional co-operative education work terms and thus have the opportunity to gain work experience.

The moon reaches perigee once per lunar cycle (every month or so). When these two times coincide the tidal range (difference between the lows and the highs) is at its maximum. The moon has the greatest influence on the tides but the sun's influence is not small, it's about one half of the moon's. 

Since the lows are as low as the get at this time of year its the best time of year to go wandering about the seashore. Be mindful of the tide coming back in though.

Photograph the highest high tides where you like to the visit the beach. These tides show you what will become the new normal sea level as climate change adds water to the oceans and increases their temperature.

*Yes indeed. The Earth is _closest_ to the sun in January. National Ocean Service All U.S. coastal regions (except for the Gulf Coast) may experience higher than normal tides from December 2-7.

We experience so-called ""king tides"" when the the sun and the moon are both at their closest approaches to the Earth. For the sun, perihelion is around 2 January* each year. The moon reaches perigee once per lunar cycle (every month or so). When these two times coincide the tidal range (difference between the lows and the highs) is at its maximum. The moon has the greatest influence on the tides but the sun's influence is not small, it's about one half of the moon's. 

Since the lows are as low as the get at this time of year its the best time of year to go wandering about the seashore. Be mindful of the tide coming back in though.

Photograph the highest high tides where you like to the visit the beach. These tides show you what will become the new normal sea level as climate change adds water to the oceans and increases their temperature.

*Yes indeed. The Earth is _closest_ to the sun in January. National Ocean Service All U.S. coastal regions (except for the Gulf Coast) may experience higher than normal tides from December 2-7.

Kwantlen Landscape Design Exams from West Coast Gardens on Vimeo .       HORT 3270 gets in the dirt    KPU?s School of Horticulture BHS degree students in the Urban Agriculture course popped along to meet with Gabriel Pliska of Frisch Farms on a fabulous fall morning in mid-October. Gabriel uses otherwise unused front- back-yards in the Arbutus-Kitsilano areas of Vancouver. With agreement from the home owners, he grows all kinds of garden vegetables, mostly through the summer season. Today, Gabriel and the students planted up a bunch of garlic for over-wintering and harvest next summer, while chatting through some of the pro?s/cons, rewards and challenges of urban agriculture on this scale.       Design Thinking in Action    Sustainable Landscape Design II students collaboratively planned and installed four visually stunning, functional patio vignettes at West Coast Gardens to successfully complete a unique practical exam. This remarkable example of experiential learning enabled the teams to reflect on critiques by West Coasts? experts and enhance the designs yet again. According to West Coast, ?The patios are being sat in and enjoyed by our customers. A few of them are missing pieces as customers have been inspired to buy and recreate at home.?       Gold and Silver at Provincial Skills Canada competition    We took home Gold and Silver medals at the Provincial Skills Canada Landscape Gardening competition held in Abbotsford at TRADEX on April 5. Urban Ecosystems degree students Anita Proom and Richard Blackwell (on the left) claimed the silver medal while Erin Stackhouse, 4th year Landscape Apprenticeship and teammate Stuart Albertson, Landscape Diploma, took home the gold (on the right). The gold medal team by way of their win will be preparing to compete at the National Skills Canada Landscape Gardening competition in Winnipeg on May 31 ? June 3.       Design theory meets practice    Our Sustainable Landscape Design II class will experience their first, one of a kind practical exam in a partnership with West Coast Gardens. The invitation to plan and implement West Coast?s wonderful range of plant materials and accessories in four- 12 ft. x 11 ft. town home patio vignettes provides a unique opportunity to move landscape design theory into practice. Based on their collaborative computer-generated designs for selected plant growth conditions and garden styles, the teams will install and critique the work and benefit from feedback from West Coast staff and customers. This industry partnership is a first for enabling the Landscape Horticulture Systems Program to incorporate this type of practical element into the course. ?Students will explore and be marked on their conventional and sustainable approaches to landscape design challenges associated with residential sites and small scale spaces.?     Horticulture hosts ?Food Projects in the Langleys? workshop   Having heard of about seven innovative agriculture/food security related projects being planned by various groups in the Township and City of Langley, the School of Horticulture decided it was time to invite everyone together and share thoughts, visions and ideas. But no-one expected there to be so many projects in development! On February 8th, representatives from a whopping 13 different groups joined the conversations and planning, and new partnerships have hopefully been born. Groups participating included planners from both municipalities, Langley Sustainable Agriculture Foundation (LSAF), Langley Environmental Partners Society (LEPS), Fraser Health, consultants from the Ministry of Agriculture, teachers and administrators from Langley School District (SD 35) and Langley Food Bank and several others. Participants spent a very busy morning of discussion facilitated by Darren Stott of Green Chain Consulting, and after comparing projects and finding common ground, the? tough work of implementing these now begins?..      Branching Out 2017    KPU Career Services and the School of Horticulture hosted the 5th ?Branching Out? Horticulture Career Fair at the Langley campus on February 7th. It provided students with an excellent opportunity to connect with potential employers and see what the future holds for them as far as their careers & employability. Just as importantly, it is a fabulous networking opportunity for all in the industry to make new colleagues and future work connections. Interest from all was overwhelming and required a waitlist of employers wanting to meet new potential employees. Thank you all who made it a success!      Pacific Agriculture Show 2017   The Pacific Agriculture Show featured many important industry meetings including the long running Horticulture Growers' Short Course. These and the various industry conferences that took place at the Show attracted high quality delegates from the agriculture and horticulture sectors as well as it represents the scope and importance of the industry, and let visitors investigate and compare the latest technology, trends and techniques available.     Burnco 2017 Lunch & Learn   Burnco Landscape Centre and the School of Horticulture has organized this remarkable event where contractors and students could mingle and to take a look at how and why vendors can help to grow and improve a business.

BCLNA 2016 Supplier of the Year   Awarded at the BCLNA Annual Christmas Party and Industry Awards evening on December 1, 2016, Shelley Murley and Rob Welsh accepted the award on behalf of the School of Horticulture.      Turfies practice for an interview    Students of HORT 1132 - Turfgrass Operations wrapped up their Fall 2016 session with ""Interview Day"". Purpose is to develop student skills of Resume, Cover letter, Portfolio and Interviewing. 4 industry professionals were the panel for 20 minute individual student interviews while their classmates watched. Each interview concluded with the panel commenting on students' performance.       Awesome Plant ID App!    KPU's School of Horticulture goes global with this innovative Plant Database App that takes plant and pest identification to a whole new level!  This app has been developed to help users quickly identify plants using smart phones and tablets. There are over 1500 plant entries and 20,000 images with close-up details of the leaves, flowers, fruits, or cones taken from the full web version of the KPU Plant Database. There are direct links to search the internet for more information on each plant or pest entry. Plant and pest favourites can also be stored (to review for tests, for consideration in a landscape plan, etc.).  The paid version allows users to upload their own images with searchable descriptions as a means to record where and when the plant was found. These plants can then be found again to observe seasonal changes, to help other users locate the plants, or to monitor plant growth or pests. Students can even create personalized digital herbarium or bug collection to become better prepared for tests!

Admission : completing an Application for Admission form, providing official transcripts of marks, and meeting other program admission requirements. How to order transcripts   Registration : selecting courses and paying tuition fees.  Admission  VIU?s programs range from fundamental literacy skills to four-year university degrees, and selected Master?s degrees and post-degree diplomas, so there is an entry level for most applicants.  Admission requirements are designed to allow access and to verify that applicants have the necessary educational background for a reasonable chance of success. Specific admission requirements for each program are listed in the Program Outlines . Advisors are available to help interpret the requirements and to assist in the admission process.  General Admission Requirements for University and Career/ Technical Programs  Canadian citizens and those with permanent residence status in Canada are eligible for admission to University and Career/Technical programs if they meet one of the following conditions:  graduation from a B.C. secondary school, or equivalent , with a minimum ?C? grade in either English 12 or English 12 First Peoples;  previous degree from a recognized university;  visiting student from a college or university (a ?Letter of Permission? from the home institution is required);  transfer student from a college or university (at least 24 transferable university-level credits completed);  mature student?at least 21 years of age (or will turn 21 in the first semester of admission) and has a minimum ?C? grade in either English 12 or English 12 First Peoples.  General Admission Requirements ? Unclassified Students  Students who do not meet any of the admission categories above may be admitted as an ?Unclassified Student? to register into University-level classes for which they meet the prerequisite. Unclassified students will register after University Program students, so course availability will be limited. Unclassified students are not considered to have been admitted to University Program studies and, for this reason, they will not be eligible for ?Continuing Student? status and must re-apply for each academic year into which they would like to register.  Canadian citizens and those with permanent residence status in Canada are eligible for admission as an Unclassified Student, if they meet one of the following conditions:  Graduation from BC secondary school, or equivalent from another school system;  Mature student category (19 years of age or older, or who will become 19 during their first semester).  General Admission Requirements for Trades & Applied Technology Programs  Graduation from BC secondary school, or equivalent from another school system, OR Mature Student Category: at least 19 years of age (or turning 19 during the first two months of the program); AND the following: Minimum 17 years of age, unless stated otherwise.  Resume and/or letter of intent and/or references may be required.  Interview may be required.  Math and/or reading and/or trades aptitude test may be required.  Physically fit and able to adapt to working conditions.  Good hand/eye coordination.  Good health, free of vision, hearing or respiratory ailments.  Valid driver?s license will be required for vehicle and equipment operation.   Mature Student Course Prerequisites  Students admitted to Vancouver Island University as ?Mature Students? must still meet individual course prerequisites. Check the Course Descriptions section of this Calendar, or consult an Advisor to find out if you first need to complete prerequisites. These prerequisite courses can be obtained through VIU?s Adult Basic Education program.  Specific Admission Requirements ? Third Year of Degree Programs  Some degree programs have specific admission requirements to enter third year, e.g., Education, Criminology, Child & Youth Care, Tourism Management. For details, please see Program Outlines .  Admission on the Basis of a Previous Degree  Applicants admitted under this category will be eligible for up to 60 transfer credits towards a VIU degree. Such applicants are cautioned to pay careful attention to course prerequisites and be aware that, in most cases, submission of a secondary school transcript is also necessary to confirm that such prerequisites have been satisfied.  Special Admission  University Credit Courses: Applicants still attending secondary school will be considered eligible to register in up to two University credit courses per semester, to a maximum of 4 courses in total. Interested applicants must submit the following documents:  a letter from the secondary school principal, giving the applicant permission to take VIU courses;  a copy of the applicant?s most recent grades accompanying the application;  a written statement from each instructor, allowing the applicant to register for a course on a credit or audit basis.  In order for a Special Admission to be considered, all documentation must be received by the Registration Centre not later than two working days prior to the first day of classes. If a student wants to be considered for Special Admission for two consecutive years prior to completing high school, all documentation must be re?submitted for the second year requested. Compliance with the above requirements does not guarantee acceptance into a course, as post?secondary students are given priority when a course is fully?subscribed.  English Language Proficiency  Applicants should be aware that, unless otherwise noted, English is the language of instruction at Vancouver Island University. Domestic students with English-as-a-Second-Language are urged to contact the Advising Centre for information on how to upgrade their English language skills, if required.  English 12  Many programs require completion of a first-year English course. All first-year English courses have a prerequisite of English 12 with a minimum grade of ?C?.  Acceptable alternatives to English 12 include First Peoples' English 12, VIU's ENGL 067 , or ESLA 050 .  Students who do not meet the English 12 requirement for admission to a program or course at Vancouver Island University may write the ACCUPLACER or Language Proficiency Index (LPI) assessment tests.  If selecting the LPI, the combination of an Essay Level of 4 or better, and a minimum total of 20/40 on the Sentence Structure, English Usage, and Reading Comprehension scores is considered by VIU to be equivalent to English 12 with a grade of ""C+?.? If selecting the ACCUPLACER, a combined average of 85 or above in the Reading Comprehension and Sentence Skills sections (with individual scores of 65 or above) and at least 5 on the Writeplacer section is considered by VIU to be equivalent to English 12 with a grade of ""C?.  High School Mathematics Courses  High school mathematics courses are key courses that are often used to determine if a student meets program admission requirements or course registration pre-requisites.  Our calendar course and program information sections contain the most up-to-date information on the acceptability of these new courses.  With respect to BC Secondary School (BCSS) mathematics courses, VIU states course and program requirements in the form of the recommended course. This is our opinion of the best course to take to prepare for a specific course or program.  Starting September 2010 the BC Ministry of Education began implementation of a new BC Secondary School mathematics curriculum for high school grades 10 to 12. In some cases Vancouver Island University also offers mathematics courses within our Faculty of Academic and Career Preparation (Adult Basic Education - ABE) and our Faculty of Science which are considered equivalent to BC Secondary School (BCSS) mathematics courses. For more information on equivalencies between BCSS, VIU ABE and VIU Faculty of Science mathematics courses please refer to the British Columbia Secondary School and VIU Math Course Equivalencies chart.  British Columbia Secondary School and VIU Math Course Equivalencies chart  Unless otherwise specified, we allow for substitutions according to the following chart:   Required Course   Alternate Acceptable Courses   Apprenticeship and Workplace Math 10    Foundations of Mathematics and Pre-calculus 10    Apprenticeship and Workplace Math 11    Foundations of Mathematics 11 or Pre-calculus 11    Apprenticeship and Workplace Math 12    Foundations of Mathematics 11 or Pre-calculus 11    Foundations of Mathematics and Pre-calculus 10    No BCSS substitution available    Foundations of Mathematics 11    Pre-calculus 11    Foundations of Mathematics 12    Pre-calculus 12    Pre-calculus 11    No BCSS substitution available    Pre-calculus 12    No BCSS substitution available    BC Provincial Exams  BC Provincial Exams are not required for admission to Vancouver Island University. With the exception of mandatory exams required by the BC Ministry of Education, Vancouver Island University does not require prospective students to write provincial exams.  International Student Admission  See International Student Admission for full details.  International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement Program  VIU recognizes the International Baccalaureate (IB) and Advanced Placement Program (APP). Under certain conditions , students presenting higher level credentials will receive university level credit, as follows:  Applicants who submit IB courses at the higher level with grades of 5 or better, and/or APP courses with grades of 4 or better, will be eligible for introductory-level University course credit. Courses with grades lower than noted will not be eligible for credit or advanced standing. See APP courses .  A maximum of 30 credits will be awarded for IB/APP courses.  Where appropriate, specific course equivalency will be granted; unassigned credit will be given where specific equivalency is not appropriate.  IB/APP credits will be noted as such on the student?s permanent record (transcript); however, no grades will be recorded and there will be no GPA implications.  Students are not precluded from enrolling in courses for which credit has been granted; however, credit may be applied only once towards a degree, diploma, or certificate.  How to Apply for Admission  Students who are planning a career or long-term academic program are urged to see an Advisor to discuss their goals. Call the Advising Centre, 250-740-6410, for an appointment.  Once students have made their choice of program(s), they should follow the steps below:  Apply to VIU or in person. Applications are accepted online via the Provincial Application Service of British Columbia (Apply.EducationPlannerBC.ca) at: Apply.EducationPlannerBC.ca . Application forms are also available from local secondary schools, Vancouver Island University offices in Duncan, Parksville and Powell River, the Registration Centre in Nanaimo, or on VIU?s Becoming a Student page.  Submit all the required documentation as specified in the admission requirements in the Program Outlines . Students will be considered for admission only when all information on the form has been supplied and all required documentation submitted. For credit programs, applicants should arrange for an official transcript to be forwarded directly to the Admissions Office from all other post-secondary institutions where previous studies have been undertaken.   Note:  Applications and documents become the property of Vancouver Island University and are NOT returned, whether a student is accepted or not. The only exception to this provision is a document considered by VIU to be irreplaceable. Such documents may be returned upon request, once a photocopy has been taken.  Students applying for more than one program should submit an application for each program.  If re-application is made to VIU, a new application must be completed, and it may be necessary to re-submit all supporting documents.   If not applying online, forward the application form(s), plus a non-refundable Application Fee , to the Registration Centre , Vancouver Island University, 900 Fifth Street, Nanaimo, B.C. V9R 5S5, for programs offered in Nanaimo. Forward the application and Application Fee to the Cowichan and Powell River campuses, or the Parksville-Qualicum Centre for programs offered at these regional campuses. Applications should be submitted well in advance of the program start date for programs starting in September; as soon as possible for programs with varying start dates. Deadlines exist for most programs; please refer to the specific Program Outlines . Regardless of the number of application forms that need to be submitted, only one set of transcripts needs to be submitted with the application forms.  Application Deadlines  The Registration Centre begins accepting applications on the first business day of October for programs which start the following September.? The application deadline is March 31 for most programs, unless otherwise indicated in the Program Outline , or the Program Availability List . Applications received after March 31 will be considered for Unclassified students.  Applicant Status Categories  Applicant  Anyone submitting a complete Application for Admission and the non-refundable Application Fee is considered an applicant.  Accepted  Applicants who meet all the requirements of the program for which they have applied, and who are notified of an available space, are considered to be accepted. Note:  Acceptance is not transferable from year to year. Applications are considered for the current school year only. An accepted applicant who is unable to enrol may re-apply for admission; however, the new application will be reviewed again for the next academic year, and a subsequent offer of admission is not guaranteed.  Conditionally Accepted  Acceptance is offered conditionally, based upon the initial information submitted by the applicant; official acceptance is dependent on final data submitted. Normally this status is available to students in programs with limited entry who are still completing prerequisite courses at the time of application.  Not Accepted  The applicant does not meet the requirements of the University or program. The applicant may wish to apply for another program. Please consult an Advisor.  Wait List  Due to enrolment limitations, students may not be able to register for courses or programs at the time or entry point of their choice. Such students will be placed on a wait list. As and when space becomes available, students will be given further instructions on how to proceed, depending on the type of course or program involved.  Deferring Admission  Students who have been admitted to the Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Business Administration, Bachelor of Education (Year 1 entry), Bachelor of Science, or Exploratory University Studies programs may request to defer their admission for one year. Requests to defer admission can be sent to registration@viu.ca .

Students will examine in separate courses the three main components of the criminal justice system?police, courts and corrections?that form an organized response to crime. The program addresses the trends and correlates of crime, including the influences of age, ethnicity, gender, and social class. The major explanations for crime try to account for these patterns by looking at historical, individual and social causes. The criminological focus is broadened with courses from other disciplines in the Social Sciences and Humanities.  The program aims to provide students with conceptual, critical and applied skills to work in fields where a legal/justice focus is beneficial. The curriculum emphasizes development of professional and applied skills though training in professional ethics, conflict mediation, use of information technology for researching relevant topics, writing, presenting data, and working in small groups on specific tasks. In fourth year, Criminology Majors have the option of either conducting an applied research project or participating in a field placement.  Although the core of the curriculum is centered on justice-related issues, students will find the degree program applies equally to areas in the private sector where research competence, project management, legal analysis and communication skills are essential.  Students interested in pursuing a B.A. with a Major in Criminology will be required to submit an application to enter the third year of the degree. Students who have completed a Diploma in Criminology or the equivalent, or who have completed the statistics and research methods requirements and are within six credits of completing their diploma, may apply for admission. Students who successfully complete the first two years of the diploma program with a minimum program cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 may apply to receive a diploma. Admission to the Major in Criminology is competitive and based on GPA in the Diploma.  A Minor will interest students wishing to include a criminological aspect to their declared Major or other declared Minor. The lower level requirements will provide students with a foundation in several key areas of the discipline including criminological theory, Canadian law, the Canadian criminal justice system, and criminological research. Access to all of the upper level criminology courses, with the exception of the Field Placement courses ( CRIM 474 and CRIM 475 ), will allow students to concentrate their studies in a particular area of interest (e.g. law) or gain exposure to a wide range of topics related to the discipline. Students who successfully complete the requirements for a Minor in Criminology with a minimum program cumulative grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 will receive a Minor.

Frequently Asked Questions    How do I decide what to take? Come talk to us. Educational advisors can connect you with a growing list of courses approved for transfer to the University of Manitoba.?Book an appointment to create a transfer plan that suits your interests and needs.    Which distance classes are available? Browse available distance education courses by term online . Enter ?Distance Education? as the course delivery method in the search window.     Can't find your high school records? No problem. NIC's Assessment Services staff can help you determine what courses are best suited to your current skills. Most university-level courses require previous high school study called prerequisites. If you haven?t been to school in a long time or if your education records are unavailable, university transfer courses are still within reach. If you are a mature student, 23 years of age or older, and believe you have the skills to perform at the same level as students in the program, you can apply for a mature student declaration. If you don?t meet a prerequisite, but feel you have the skill set to be successful, you can meet with the instructor to discuss whether a prerequisite waiver is an option for you. There is no age limitation to apply for a prerequisite waiver but prerequisites are in place to ensure you succeed in the course. Meet with an educational advisor to determine the best options to meet your goals.     Can I take courses at both institutions at the same time? Yes. Request a letter of permission from NIC, apply as a visiting student at the University of Manitoba and then register for your courses. When your classes are complete, request a transcript from the University of Manitoba and send it to NIC. We?ll apply transfer credit for your courses.    What are credits? Credits describe a course's value. A one-term course, normally requiring four months of study (September to December, or January to April), equals three credits. Some courses are also available during the spring and summer sessions in a condensed format.    I'm a military student, can I receive recognition for my rank, military education and training? Yes! At NIC, non-commissioned members at or above the Master Corporal/Master Seaman rank and officers at or above the Captain/Lieutenant (Navy) rank receive six unassigned arts credits?to allow you to?earn?your?degree faster. When you take?courses?at?the University of Manitoba, they'll evaluate your military education and training to?provide you with?additional?credits.    Can?I get reimbursed for my tuition and books? Canadian Forces members are encouraged to speak to the Personnel Selection Officer at 250-339-8211 x8293 to learn more about available educational opportunities.    What if military duty or deployment interrupts my studies? As a military member, NIC allows you to withdraw from courses and receive a full refund when unexpected military duty interrupts your university study. You must withdraw from your courses as soon as possible and send documentation from a superior officer verifying your military obligations to NIC?s Student Services Office.    What if my military duties cause me to submit an assignment late? It is up to your instructor to decide to accept a late assignment. Some instructors state their policy in advance while others address student needs on a case-by-case basis. Most instructors are very understanding, but you should contact them as soon as you realize you will be late.

Anywhere. Anytime.    The Remote Web-Based Science Laboratory (RWSL) provides students and educators access to high-quality online labs in real time, both from home or in the classroom, when most convenient for them. More    Architect   Albert Balbon has pioneered distance education delivery at North Island College for 29 years. In 2002, Albert and Ron Evans created a system to allow distance astronomy students to explore the universe from the comfort of home using a remote telescope. That technology paved the way for development of the RWSL in 2004.  Today, Albert works with North Island College and the North American Network of Science Labs Online (NANSLO) to further develop and share this technology with innovators.           In a lot of cases, [schools are] still not using equipment that?s this high end, even in face-to-face experiments, because schools can?t justify the expenditure for a piece of equipment they may only use once or twice a year, whereas the RWSL allows us to use it every week of the year, if we want to. Where we see one of our biggest advantages is in labs that require very precise, high-quality data or very rare pieces of equipment that schools are just not able to afford or have access to.  PJ Bennett, NANSLO Lab Technology Manager      NIC's Remote Web-based Science Laboratories, or RWSL, allow users to view, interact, control and collect real data from actual science lab equipment in real time over the Internet. Students can view and control many types of equipment, including microscopes with camera and auto loaders, spectrometers with varying light sources and autoloaders, and air tracks/sleds. The remotely-accessible scientific equipment available through RWSL removes barriers such as region, lab availability, or the cost of maintaining multiple labs, and provides students with equal access to high quality scientific experiences.  RWSL has been developed with funding from various organizations who support advances in education technology, including BCcampus, the Next Generation Learning Challenges, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Flora Hewlett Foundation.

This research project aims to discover more about this transformation process and the influence of transformative learning within the nursing program.  By documenting and analyzing the transformation in students? perspectives, values, beliefs, attitudes, assumptions, behaviours, and the process that shifted their perspectives, we hope to:   Explore new understandings of the role of transformative learning within the classroom  Develop additional cultural experiences and indigenous pedagogy within the classroom and practice  Continue to create curriculum, culture and leadership within our academic institution that includes Aboriginal and other student cultures  Engage students and faculty in research  Create additional program evaluation tools  Share knowledge gained   Researchers   Joanna Fraser  Fourth year nursing students, graduates, and faculty        USING AN UNFOLDING CASE STUDY AS CONTEXTUAL LEARNING: SUPPORTING NOVICE NURSING STUDENTS TO ?THINK LIKE A NURSE?   Nursing students have learned psychomotor skills in isolation from the context in which they are practiced.  This project introduces an unfolding case to support critical thinking and clinical decision making skills in student nurses.  Throughout the semester, the unfolding case study utilizes a blend of live actors and human patient simulators as students learn to care for a patient with chronic health challenges through admission and hospitalization. The patient?s clinical situation is designed to be realistic and challenging, presenting students with unpredictable and incomplete assessment data.  The research aims to understand:   How contextual learning, specifically an unfolding patient case can affect students? ability to care for complex patients earlier in their education.  The impact of combining theory, assessments, relational practice and psychomotor skills on students capacity to provide client-centred care.  How a shift to contextual learning might support novice students in managing the gap between practice and theory.   Researchers    Martha Russell , RN, MN, Jan Meiers , RN, MN Martha Russell and Jan Meiers are BSN faculty members at NIC. They have presented their work related to the creative use of simulation to enhance nursing education at conferences across in Western Canada and will be presenting in Atlanta, Georgia in June 2015.        DOCUMENTING A RURAL COMMUNITIES? SHIFT FROM PRIMARY TO COLLABORATIVE PRENATAL CARE GROUP PREGNANCY PROJECT:   The Group Pregnancy project is an innovative care model designed to promote safety, efficiency, effectiveness, timeliness and culturally appropriate care to women and their families during the prenatal and immediate post-partum periods.  Instead of seeing a primary care provider in an exam room, women see primary care providers, nurse/educators, and peers together throughout their term to reduce barriers and create more positive experiences for families and practitioners. Evidence is now emerging this model indicates greater client satisfaction, effective care delivery, and better health outcomes, such as lower rates of preterm birth.  Our research sought to capture qualitative data from families and practitioners about their experiences with this shift in practice over three years.

Studies to date develop knowledge about how mobile learning effectively supports the teaching and learning of nursing students in education and in nursing practicums. It finds mobile learning supports more situated, experiential and contextualized learning and affords the use of up-to-date and accurate content and information. In practice education, it has the potential to bring instructors, peers, and resources together virtually at the point-of-care to support the students? safety and evidence-informed practice.  This study addresses faculty and students might adopt and normalize mobile learning technology in nursing education.  It aims to understand:   The factors that influence nursing faculty and students in their decision-making concerning the adoption of mobile devices in their teaching and learning.  How nursing faculty and students make sense of, grasp the potential benefits and importance of, mobile device use in their program.  How nursing faculty and students might implement and support the use of mobile devices in their program.

Funding from the Federal Government will provide three Selkirk College projects with the resources required to further advance innovative collaborative partnerships with community organizations and local businesses.  The Social Sciences & Humanities Research Council has announced that Selkirk College will receive three grants from the Community & College Social Innovation Fund (CCSIF) totaling $603,430. The funds are part of Minister of Science Kirsty Duncan?s announced $7.4 million worth of federal dollars that will be provided to 35 research projects at colleges and polytechnics across the country.   Selkirk College has secured three grants from the Federal Government for research and innovation projects. Two of the team leaders on the projects include Selkirk Geospatial Research Coordinator Ian Parfitt (left) and Regional Innovation Chair Terri MacDonald (right).  ?The federal research councils? adjudication processes for programs like this are very rigorous and the competition is stiff,? says Dr. Neil Coburn, Selkirk College Vice President of Education & Students. ?In this round, less than half of the proposals were funded. Just getting one approval is a significant achievement. Getting all three of our applications approved is incredible. It demonstrates the dedication, focus and quality that the applicants have put into our innovation and applied research initiatives.?  A Trio of Impactful Projects  The three Selkirk College projects focus on regional workforce development, open data for open government, and advancing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission?s Calls to Action through community college dialogue and education.  The Columbia Basin Rural Development Institute (RDI) is heading up the Regional Workforce Development in Rural BC project. Funding will support more than 30 research positions for college students, graduate students and college faculty researchers. Researchers will work alongside an impressive list of regional, provincial and national partners to identify and answer emerging workforce development research questions.  ?Taking an informed and collaborative approach to preparing our 21 st Century workforce is critical for our rural region,? says Dr. Terri MacDonald, Regional Innovation Chair at RDI . ?Having secured $450,000 of in-kind and cash support from more than 30 partners, in addition to the $240,000 in federal funding, positions us well to undertake this important work.?  Under the Open Data for Open Government in Rural BC Project, the Selkirk Geospatial Research Centre (SGRC) will work with several community partners including the Regional District of Central Kootenay. Linking to Geothink ?a Canadian Geospatial and Open Data Research Partnership?and building on collaborations with the RDI under the State of the Basin and Digital Basin initiatives, this research will investigate the potential outcomes of open data policy at the local scale for rural regions and communities.  ?An Advanced Diploma in GIS student and a Bachelor of GIS student will be funded to participate in this project each year over the next three years,? says SGRC Coordinator Ian Parfitt. ?The grant will also support a Master?s student in the second and third year of the project. These students will work directly with local government on developing open data best practices.?  Creating Authentic Partnerships  The project Exploring Reconciliation Through Community College Education, will support important dialogues between residential school survivors in the region and post-secondary institutions. Participants will inform the project team on ways to be more open and responsive as educational institutions.  ?So many of the negative impacts on Indigenous families and communities stemmed from the failed education system,? says Jessica Morin, Selkirk College?s Aboriginal Services Liaison . ?It?s time to work together to create a system that reflects the values of First Nations, M?tis and Inuit peoples, and is based in true authentic partnerships.?  Only George Brown College and Sheridan College ?both large urban colleges in the Toronto region?received three CCSIF grants showing the Federal Government?s confidence in Selkirk College as a leader in rural research and innovation.  ?The announcement of this funding is an example of the great work being done by our staff and students,? says Coburn. ?We continue to look for rich learning opportunities like these where students work with the community on projects that will have important outcomes for our region.?

The Fit for Snow program was developed after extensive research and has already produced proven results.  Those who embrace the thrills of the outdoors in winter rely upon snowsport resort workers to keep the terrain in top shape, teach proper techniques, get them safely to the top of the runs and swoop in when things go awry. With that type of responsibility, it?s essential snowcat operators, ski school instructors, liftees and patrollers are up the challenge.  Through the Fit for Snow program , Selkirk College biology instructor Dr. Delia Roberts helps provide the tools to ensure snowsport resort workers overcome the rigours of the winter season.  ?There is a high injury rate associated with people who work at ski resorts,? says Roberts. ?So the main outcome of Fit for Snow was to protect the young people who are working in those resorts from injuries.?   Selkirk College biology instructor practices what she preaches by living a healthy outdoor lifestyle.  Industry Reaches Out for Answers  The Canada West Ski Association approached Roberts in 2010, asking her to put together a program specific to the industry based on her research and applied methods for tree planters ( Fit to Plant ) and mountain guides. The specific aim was to characterize the factors that contribute to injuries in ski patrols, lift operators and snowsport instructors?including poor control of joint stability, poor dietary practices, inattention and fatigue.  With assistance from a WorkSafe BC grant, Roberts embarked on a study that included 25 patrol staff, 25 lift operators and 25 instructors at five resorts in Western Canada?Whitewater, Red Mountain, Sun Peaks, Sunshine and Lake Louise?that volunteered to participate. The extensive research included pre-season assessments, daily monitoring of heart rate during the season, detailed recording of food and drink consumption, and a host of other tests.  ?There is a fair bit of work that goes on now around worksite health and looking at the benefits in terms of decreased absenteeism, decreased turnover, and better performance at work,? says Roberts. ?But there are very few studies where people have evaluated a targeted intervention specific to the needs of an occupation and say: what exactly is it that this group needs? Most of what is out there tends to be a lot more general.?  Taking Olympians to the Next Level  Roberts has spent many years studying ways the human body can better perform under stressful situations. She started her journey as an exercise physiologist at the University of Calgary where she first graduated with a Bachelor of Science in biochemistry. From there she went to a Master?s Degree in exercise biochemistry and a PhD in medical science.  Working under the mentorship of renowned exercise physiologist Dr. David Smith at the University of Calgary, Roberts had the opportunity to be part of the staff working at the High Performance Laboratory which helped train Olympic athletes. Between 1984 and 1998, Roberts worked with many Olympians including medalists Michelle Cameron and Carolyn Waldo (synchronized swimming), Mark Tewksbury (swimming), and long track speed skaters Catriona Le May Doan , Susan Auch, Jeremy Wotherspoon and Kevin Overland.  Roberts attended three Olympic games?Los Angeles, Calgary , Albertville?as part of the Canadian team and also provided support for athletes leading up to the games in Seoul, Barcelona and Lillehammer. During that time, she did research into biochemical markers of fatigue and specific adaptive responses to training. Robert?s PhD focussed on developing the altitude training program used by the speedskaters and swimmers from 1992-2000.  ?The timing was really good for me because sports science was a very young science so practically anything that I looked at was brand new,? Roberts says of her work in Calgary.  Finding the Right Fit in the Kootenay  With a young family in tow, Roberts moved to the Kootenays in 1998 to take a position teaching in the University Arts & Sciences Program at Selkirk College. In 2000, Roberts initiated a forest industry supported research project aimed at reducing injuries to tree planters. Following the athlete model she worked with for many years, the resulting Fit to Plant program has proven to reduce injuries by 40% and increase productivity by 12% for companies that implement it.   Selkirk College instructor Dr. Delia Roberts came to the Kootenays in 1998.  ?I get good results because I am not just throwing something generic out,? Roberts explains. ?I define very carefully exactly what the problem is, so that the solution I provide is both contextually and culturally specific. In the end it talks to the worker in a language they can relate to directly.?  Following the completion of the Fit for Snow data collection after the 2010-2011 season, Roberts constructed a corrective program specific to the needs of the snow sport industry. Using the same five resorts, Roberts provided on-site training and made the Fit for Snow books available to a sample of employees. The result was a significant reduction in the number and severity of injuries with worker compensation claims dropping by 67% overall.  Last season Whistler-Blackcomb signed up for the program specifically targeting a test group of 250 of its 1,500 ski instructors. Roberts brought a team of Selkirk graduates to help her provide workshops and training for the employees. This season the program is being used by Nelson?s Whitewater and Baldface Lodge , Great Canadian Heli-Skiing, Taos Ski Valley in New Mexico, and Schweitzer Mountain Resort in Idaho.  On January 21-23, Roberts will travel to Steamboat, Colorado where she has been invited to speak at the National Ski Areas Association?s Western Winter Conference.  ?I really believe in this because there is so much positive that comes out of it,? says Roberts, who is now developing a program aimed at forest industry fallers. ?I?ve lived a healthy lifestyle my whole life and I reap the benefits of it every day. I see myself almost as a translator where I take this body of knowledge that exists through sport science and I translate it for a population of people who need that information. It?s huge to be able to help empower people to take control of their life.?  Learn more about Fit for Snow and join us on Facebook .

Brandon University also has a Engineering 3? + 2 dual degree program agreement with the University of Minnesota.? Contact Dr. Austin Gulliver , Acting Dean of Science, for more information.  Applied Disaster & Emergency Studies  This program was the first degree program of its type in Canadian universities, and introduces students to a broad range of technological, cultural and environmental risks of disasters with an emphasis on how the social and physical factors interact in disasters. Graduates of the program are able to assist with all aspects of emergency management, including traditional preparedness and response activities as well as recovery efforts to help people affected by disasters get their lives back to normal and mitigation planning to prevent future damages. Applied Disaster and Emergency Studies adopts a liberal arts and sciences approach to foster an appreciation for the interdisciplinary nature of the field. The ADES curriculum balances theory and practice as well as the social and physical science perspectives.  Biology  Biology is about much more than the scientific study of life. In the first year of study you are introduced to the variety and diversity of life on the planet. Students in Biology can prepare for careers in the biological and biomedical sciences through more detailed courses. Many students focus on the study of evolutionary relationships among species. Other students prepare for a future in laboratory research using tools ranging from molecular biology to microbial breeding. Our program has a reputation for producing high-quality students who go on to earn higher degrees in more specialized fields.  Chemistry  Chemistry deals with the nature of and changes in matter, which is why there are few sciences that do not involve chemistry.  Chemists study the nature of atoms, how atoms combine to produce molecules, and the properties of these molecules and how they react to produce new substances. Many of the comforts and conveniences we enjoy today are the result of the effective use of chemical knowledge. Think about fuels, plastics, food additives and drugs ? these are only a few of the chemical products we use daily. While yielding many benefits to our society, chemistry has also been at the forefront of controversy, such as with pollution, global warming and chemical warfare. The Chemistry Department attempts to convey to students some of the limitations of present knowledge and the need for further research.  Computer Science  Computer technology is growing rapidly and affecting our lives in many different ways. The computer is a powerful tool for storing, retrieving, manipulating and presenting data. A special by-product of studying computer science is the learning and developing of an ability to solve the problems that are important in today?s changing world.  In first year computer science, you will learn the Java programming language. The course is designed to challenge people who are fond of computers and mathematics, and possess the ability to think logically. Students with these interests or abilities will find computer science courses fascinating.  Careers  Business Research Software Development Systems Analysis Systems Testing and Support  Special Features  In addition to the various computer laboratories, the department runs the ?BitCave? high-tech laboratory for senior students.  Environmental Science  Environmental Science is the study of the interaction between plants and animals and the environment, and human impacts on these systems. This 4-year interdisciplinary program provides the scientific background necessary to address environmental issues such as pollution, climate change, resource management, and the conservation of wildlife and their habitats. This degree offers a wide range of career opportunities.  The program includes courses offered by each of the departments in the Faculty of Science, as well as courses from the Faculty of Arts such as Environmental Ethics.  Special Features  All students complete a final year research project in preparation for professional practice.  Geography  If you?re interested in the relationships between the environment and society and want to learn about landscapes and people, consider studying geography. Geography is about place and space. It studies the interdependence among regions, natural systems, physical features, society and cultural activities. Using a ?spatial? perspective, it aims to form a coherent understanding of Earth. Geographers explore answers to questions like: Where are things or people located on the surface of the earth? Why are they located there? What processes are at work in developing those regions or features?  People with geography skills apply what they know in a wide variety of fields. Our recent grads have embarked on careers in urban and regional land use planning, conservation and resource management, mapping, geographic information systems and remote sensing, parks and recreation, teaching and research.  Special Features  The department hosts the Center for Geomatics, which is a dedicated computer lab with facilities for geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing and cartography. Practical training in this field significantly increases your employment marketability upon graduation.  Brandon University has arranged block transfer agreements for graduates from the Environmental Technologies programs at Assiniboine Community College (ACC) who wish to complete a concentration in geography. Students who have graduated from ACC with the Environmental Technologies Diploma in Land & Water Management may be eligible for a block transfer of 60 credit hours into the BU Department of Geography Environmental Studies Concentration. Students who have graduated from ACC with the Environmental Technologies diploma in GIS may be eligible for a block transfer of 60 credit hours into the BU Department of Geography Geomatics Concentration.  Geology  Geology is the study of the planet Earth. It is concerned with the origins of our planet, the evolution of life, the materials and morphology of the Earth and its history. It deals with the processes that shape the present landscape and those that acted throughout geologic time. Because the earth is a naturally occurring physical-chemical system, geology draws on other sciences such as chemistry, physics, biology, mathematics and geography. The modern geologist is a well-rounded scientist.  Geology is a practical science ? geologic knowledge is applied in the search for sustainable development of Earth?s mineral and energy resources, and the evaluation of groundwater resources and environmental concerns. The Earth is dynamic, and geoscientists study and predict earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and other natural phenomena, and their mitigation.  Careers  Petroleum Industry Mining Industry Environmental Geologist Government Agencies Teaching Graduate Studies in Geology Resource Exploration Consulting  Special Features  The honours four-year degree program provides the academic requirements to become a registered Professional Geoscientist.  Mathematics  Mathematics involves the use of deductive reasoning and constitutes the basic language of the physical sciences. It is a way of thinking, a disciplined and logical approach to problem solving that will be of interest to people who enjoy mathematics either for its inherent interest or as a method of problem solving in related disciplines.  Mathematics is growing today more than ever before ? both as a subject in its own right and in terms of its influence on science, engineering and business. Some of the more recent advances in physics, chemistry and biology use mathematical concepts. The divisions of science that previously used few, if any, mathematical skills are now putting more and more emphasis on mathematical reasoning and techniques. Statistics, which is an area of mathematics concerned with data analysis, is increasingly used in such disciplines as psychology, sociology, business and health studies.  Careers  Accounting Actuarial Science Banking Insurance Statistical Research Teaching  Those pursuing careers in business management need to have some background in mathematics in order to understand some of the computer-based decision-making processes now in use.  Physics  Are you interested in the structure of matter and the interactions between the components that make up that matter? If so, you may make an excellent physicist or astronomer.  Physicists employ two strategies when examining matter: they conduct practical experiments and they make theoretical calculations. Physics is a basic science and permeates all other sciences, engineering, and technology. The scale of topics is vast. For example, in size and mass, topics ranges from elementary particles to the edges of the observable universe. Nonetheless, in our everyday world, physics is applied in meteorology, medicine, geophysics (exploration) and electronics. The challenges are endless!  Physics is increasing our knowledge on a daily basis through work in the traditional subdivisions of mechanics, wave motion, heat, electricity and magnetism and the so-called ?modern physics?.  Careers  Administrator Industrial and Governmental Researcher Physicist Software Developer Teacher  Special Features  Departmental facilities include a high-resolution reflector telescope.  Psychology  Since psychological principles operate anywhere there are people, an understanding of these principles will help you make sense of why people behave as they do and, most importantly, how people learn.  Psychology serves a large percentage of the student body. Each faculty member specializes in a particular area of psychology. A wide variety of courses, representing the major topics that psychologists consider to be of importance in the understanding of behavior, are available. You may select areas of study that offer opportunities to carry out laboratory or field research under the supervision of a faculty member.  Careers  Business Consulting Counselling Law Social Services Social Work Teaching  Special Features  Graduates who choose a career in academic psychology have a wide variety of paths to consider. Research into human social behavior and personality, child development, life span psychology and other areas provide numerous and fascinating challenges.  Psychology, like other sciences, has become dependent on the use of computer technology for the study of behavior, artificial intelligence, and brain processes, so that students who are interested in computer applications will find demands for their skills.

Academic Plan ? Post-Secondary Education Trends    Post-Secondary Education Trends  Brandon University is affected by the many trends in post-secondary education (PSE).  In 2007-2008, the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada (AUCC, 2008) published a three volume series on trends in PSE. Several other publications have outlined trends affecting the PSE sector (e.g., Billing, 2004; Lebeau, Stumpf, Brown, Lucchesi, & Kwiek, 2012; Mayhew, 2013; McArthur, 2010). Based on these documents and other research, trends in post-secondary education can be clustered into the following areas:   Competition for domestic and international students is becoming fiercer. The Statistics Canada (2007) report, entitled Postsecondary Enrolment Trends to 2031: Three Scenarios, provides three different scenarios for projections of college and university enrolments for the population aged between 17 and 29 years. Each of these scenarios points to increased competition for domestic students in Canadian universities.  In 2011, the Aboriginal population, consisting of First Nations Peoples, Metis and Inuit, was 157,740 or 14 percent of Manitoba?s total population (Statistics Canada, 2011a). Between 55 percent and 65 percent of the Aboriginal population aged 18-44 years plans to return to school or to take further training. Across Canada, the average age of the Aboriginal population is less than that of the overall population, with 18.2 percent in the age range of 15 to 24 years as compared with 12.9 percent in the general population. At Brandon University, 13-15 percent of the student population self-identify as members of an Aboriginal community. It can be anticipated that the number of Aboriginal students in the age range15to 24 years aiming to attend post-secondary educational institutions in Manitoba will increase.  Between 2006 and 2011, the City of Brandon has experienced a strong population growth of about 11 percent to over 46,000 and, in 2014, at about 53,000 as compared with the provincial growth rate of 5.2 percent over the same period. The region?s immigrant population is growing.  Brandon University plays an important role in rural education in Manitoba. Statistics Canada (2011b) data estimate the rural population of Manitoba at 333,554 for 2011, a number that has been relatively stable over the past 50 years (e.g., the rural population was 332,879 in 1961). The urban population in Manitoba over this time period has significantly increased, reaching 874,714 in 2011 as compared with 588,807 in 1961.  A Statistics Canada factsheet (2012) shows tertiary (college or university) education attainment at about 46 percent within Manitoba compared to a high of 58 percent in Ontario and 51 percent overall across Canada. University degree attainment for Manitoba is 18.4 percent compared to the high of 24.7 percent for Ontario and a Canada-wide average of 22.2 percent.  Individuals in the workforce within Manitoba as a whole, and Brandon and southwestern Manitoba in particular, are competing for opportunities at national and global levels, with professional advancement that is often dependent on possessing post-secondary education at the undergraduate or graduate level.  There are financial pressures for government funding and tuition freezes or reductions when adjusted for operating cost inflation. In addition for some universities, pension plan actuarial deficits are demanding that up to 10 percent of operating budget be channeled into pension sustainability funding.  Research costs are accelerating, while funding opportunities are shrinking, and universities are required to establish research strategies as part of the Tri-Council framework. Brandon University recently completed its Research Strategic Plan with a focus on community-engaged research.  Across Canada, community colleges are increasingly being permitted to offer applied degrees. Most provinces have established educational goals and degree classification frameworksbased on the Ministerial Statement on Quality Assurance of Degree Education that emerged from the Council of Ministers of Education in 2007. A drive towards university accountability, differentiation, and specialization is evident in response to the government-articulated mandate of the PSE sector (e.g., the U15 drive across Canada and the university differentiation framework in Ontario).  Universities play an important part in fostering innovation, productivity gains, and prosperity within society. Brandon University is viewed as an important partner and catalyst for community and economic development within the southwestern Manitoba region.  We are experiencing increased information technological sophistication of students, rising in-class and distance technology-augmented courses, and varying readiness on the part of faculty and staff to adopt new technological changes (including changes in Campus Manitoba towards facilitating more credit transfer through increased online courses and inter-institutional mobility).  Society is re-evaluating the value of university relative to community college or apprenticeship training, and concerns are rising about youth unemployment and job permanency in the wake of raising student debt and perceived diminished capacity to attain parents? standard of living.  There are growing institutional domestic and international strategic partnerships to realize opportunities for joint academic programs, collaborative research, and shared infrastructure and operating costs (e.g., the Brandon University and Assiniboine Community College Memorandum of Understanding for collaborative programming).  Globalization demands that education prepare students to be global citizens, and students expect universities to meet national as well as international standards.  Students expect universities to provide them with the critical skills and practical training to gain employment while attaining knowledge and understanding through lifelong learning.  Tri-Council funding emphasizes the training of highly qualified personnel (e.g., graduate students) in the determination of research funding allocation. Additionally, universities within Canada are competing for these funds along with the acknowledgement of arguments for research funding to be tilted towards U15 (i.e., the top 15 research institutions within Canada) and away from teaching and learning-focused universities. The importance of research, scholarly and creative activities in informing teaching and learning outcomes at universities is widely accepted, suggesting that a teaching university must move towards being a teaching and research-oriented institution if the interests of students are to be served effectively.   These trends affecting universities are combined with mounting broad social and institutional issues. Western society has generally viewed education as a key mechanism for social mobility. The rising concentration of wealth has challenged this notion even though education continues to be a key determinant of income and standards of living. Similarly, studies such as Fein (2014) and ?Glastris et al.? (2011) have recently found that liberal arts and science education is less likely to support social mobility than professional/career-oriented education in the absence of the pre-existing social network, including parents having completed post-secondary education. As a result, it is not surprising that first generation students look towards the completion of professional and career-oriented programs over liberal arts programs.  On the other hand, liberal arts and science programs focus on literacies and critical thinking skills that are crucial for upward mobility within the job setting. Critical thinking skill development, inherent in liberal arts and science education, is also crucial for broad civic and leadership contributions. Therefore, universities often struggle to find the right balance between liberal arts/science and professional programs to meet their students? needs. Superimposed on these considerations are institutional issues in the arena of change management.  Faced with budget pressures, government demands for reduction in program redundancies, and transition towards programs demanded by students, universities have developed approaches from doing nothing (hoping the problems will be addressed by another generation of faculty members and administers) to program prioritization processes. While it may be easy or even justifiable to be critical of either extreme, academic plans are as much about how university faculty, staff, students and others come together to collaborate in making collegial decisions about the future of the university as they are about what decisions are actually made. The aim of Brandon University?s Academic Plan is to build a shared vision, a consensus that supports the building of a university that is collaborative and collegial as much as it is innovative and leading among peer institutions.

Students get real world/practical experience with stream gauging at field sites near Brandon University          If you are interested in the relationships between the environment and society and want to learn about landscapes and people, consider studying geography. Geography is about place and space. It studies the interdependence among regions, natural systems, physical features, society, and cultural activities. Using a ?spatial? perspective, it aims to form a coherent understanding of Earth.  People with geography skills apply what they know successfully in a wide variety of fields. Out recent grads have embarked on careers in urban and regional land use planning, conservation and resource management, mapping, geographic information systems and remote sensing, parks and recreation, teaching and research.  Students have an opportunity to gain hands-on experience through a practicum course, with applied academic training in geography to a project on or off campus. Others work closely with faculty to pursue their interests in a specific field of geography in a Directed Studies or Undergraduate Thesis course.  Centre for Geomatics  The department hosts the Centre for Geomatics, which is a dedicated computer lab with facilities for geographic information systems (GIS), remote sensing and cartography. Practical training in this field significantly increases your employment marketability upon graduation.

The area boasts a number of faculty members who investigate human psychology from a biological perspective, providing students with opportunities to investigate the physiological processes underlying learning, memory, visual perception, and visuomotor control. Members of this area also offer training in developmental neuroscience and psychobiology, neuropsychology, cardiovascular psychobiology and stress, neurotoxicology, psychopharmacology, neurological impairments, and fMRI. This area also hosts several specialists in the experimental study of human and non-human mental processes. The Department?s cognitive scientists provide expertise in the domains of text comprehension, visual and auditory perception, selective attention, memory, learning, and categorization. The operant behaviour laboratory offers students the opportunity to study learning in animals (with the current emphasis being on fish) in a controlled environmental space. Research opportunities offered by the Avian Behaviour Laboratory provide a unique opportunity for students to develop skills in the study of animal behaviour in a natural setting. Members of the Brain & Cognitive Sciences area receive funding from a variety of sources, resulting in cutting-edge research laboratories that utilize modern and diverse techniques. Both M.A. and Ph.D. training provides students with opportunities to develop their ability to think critically and work independently, while still being able to successfully collaborate and work as part of a team. The course requirements in the area are structured around a flexible core curriculum that permits specialization and concentration of research during graduate training. Students are given the opportunity to collaborate with faculty from other areas in the Department of Psychology at the University of Manitoba and with faculty in other Departments of Psychology in the region, such as researchers at the University of Winnipeg and members of the Centre for Visual Neuroscience at the University of North Dakota. The breadth of graduate student training in this area is further enhanced by opportunities to collaborate with researchers in related social, behavioural, and biomedical sciences. For example, members of the Brain & Cognitive Sciences area maintain ongoing research relationships with researchers in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Manitoba and members of the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. Below is a complete listing of The Brain and Cognitive Sciences laboratories led by area members. The principal investigator of each laboratory is provided. ?Lab names are given in parentheses.

In doing so, the CFPC identified some of the more notable research that has been carried out by family medicine researchers.  Each study selected underlines a key concept that is central to ensuring effective and efficient delivery of primary care, and embraces the values of family medicine in research. The seven key concepts under which the landmark papers are listed are as follows:   Importance of Family Physicians  Patient-Centred Care  Family Physicians Transforming Practice  Electronic Medical Records  Evidence Versus Ideology  Community Engagement and Aboriginal Health  Ethics, Public Health and Primary Care    Available Grants and Funding Opportunities  A list of awards (along with descriptions, deadlines, etc.) applicable to residents is available on the PGME website. All research awards available are listed here ; however, some are not applicable to residents/novice researchers.  The College of Family Physicians of Canada (CFPC)  Patient Education Grants for Family Medicine Residents The grants support residents working on projects during their training (e.g., research, developing learning tools) and in the creation and promotion of materials, tools and presentations specifically addressing gaps in patient education resources and updating existing information.  Research Awards for Family Medicine Residents The chairs and research directors of each family medicine residency program identify the most outstanding research project from their program.  North American Primary Care Research Group (NAPCRG)  Distinguished Trainee Research Awards The Distinguished Trainee Research Awards are intended to promote and acknowledge outstanding completed primary care research conducted by trainees (undergraduate students, medical students, graduate students, residents, and fellows) to those submitting an abstract as the primary (first) author for completed research projects.

The area boasts a number of faculty members who investigate human psychology from a biological perspective, providing students with opportunities to investigate the physiological processes underlying learning, memory, visual perception, and visuomotor control. Members of this area also offer training in developmental neuroscience and psychobiology, neuropsychology, cardiovascular psychobiology and stress, neurotoxicology, psychopharmacology, neurological impairments, and fMRI. This area also hosts several specialists in the experimental study of human and non-human mental processes. The Department?s cognitive scientists provide expertise in the domains of text comprehension, visual and auditory perception, selective attention, memory, learning, and categorization. The operant behaviour laboratory offers students the opportunity to study learning in animals (with the current emphasis being on fish) in a controlled environmental space. Research opportunities offered by the Avian Behaviour Laboratory provide a unique opportunity for students to develop skills in the study of animal behaviour in a natural setting. Members of the Brain & Cognitive Sciences area receive funding from a variety of sources, resulting in cutting-edge research laboratories that utilize modern and diverse techniques. Both M.A. and Ph.D. training provides students with opportunities to develop their ability to think critically and work independently, while still being able to successfully collaborate and work as part of a team. The course requirements in the area are structured around a flexible core curriculum that permits specialization and concentration of research during graduate training. Students are given the opportunity to collaborate with faculty from other areas in the Department of Psychology at the University of Manitoba and with faculty in other Departments of Psychology in the region, such as researchers at the University of Winnipeg and members of the Centre for Visual Neuroscience at the University of North Dakota. The breadth of graduate student training in this area is further enhanced by opportunities to collaborate with researchers in related social, behavioural, and biomedical sciences. For example, members of the Brain & Cognitive Sciences area maintain ongoing research relationships with researchers in the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Manitoba and members of the Manitoba Centre for Health Policy. Below is a complete listing of The Brain and Cognitive Sciences laboratories led by area members. The principal investigator of each laboratory is provided. ?Lab names are given in parentheses.

One may also take courses in the more applied areas which deal with the application of statistical methods as a framework for interpreting data. In addition, the Statistics Department offers courses in Operations Research and Stochastic Modeling which are applicable in telecommunications, transportation, and manufacturing systems. Computer programs are often used in the analysis of large data sets and in simulation; therefore, it is advisable for students to gain some knowledge of statistical computing and programming.  The Statistics Department offers 3-Year and 4-Year BA or BSc degree programs. Students who are not Statistics Majors will find that a background in statistics is valuable in many areas, in which the use of statistical methods to test theories and develop models is increasing; for some programs, certain Statistics courses are required.  Statistical techniques are in wide use in virtually every branch of the Physical, Social, Biological, and Human Sciences. Statisticians often work in close cooperation with specialists in other fields to assist in the design and analysis of research data. A statistician may assist economists in the analysis of consumer prices, as well as with the design and analysis of large-scale socio-economic surveys. A statistician may help biologists, chemists or engineers in the design and analysis of experiments, or work with doctors to test the effectiveness of new drugs. Other opportunities can be found in finance, marketing, and quality management, as well as in research facilities where statisticians develop new and better statistical methods. Many statisticians find employment with private corporations and government agencies including Statistics Canada.  read more   The University of Winnipeg's Tutoring Centre provides one-to-one and small group tutoring in Applied Computer Science (ACS), Chemistry, Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, and Writing.

    and includes the analysis of algorithms, the study of computer architectures, compilers and
    operating systems, networks, and software engineering. Our goal is to introduce students to
    all facets of the discipline, and to give them an appreciation of the historical, ethical,
    and social context of computing, and the responsibility of the computer professional and
    casual computer user in a modern society.  The Department offers a broad variety of courses
    and programs in Computer Science. Introductory courses may teach programming and theories
    of computing or offer a general overview of the use and application of popular
    microcomputer software; more advanced courses deal with topics ranging from artificial
    intelligence and the role of computers in society to the design and implementation of
    advanced hardware or software systems. All courses in the computing curriculum offer a
    blend of theory and practical application, with many of the offerings having a significant
    project component in which students are given the opportunity to apply the classroom
    material to real-world problems. Courses are designed to address the needs of a wide
    variety of users, from the casual to the professional. Some students may enrol in a course
    to familiarize themselves with the microcomputer and application software, while others may
    choose to pursue a minor or a major in Computer Science. Students may choose to select
    Computer Science in combination with areas such as English, Economics, Philosophy, or
    Physics. Mount Allison has been quite successful in placing its students in graduate
    programs in Computer Science, while many others have found employment after graduation in
    one of the many computer-related fields.  Disciplinary B.A. and B.Sc. Programs  B.A. or B.Sc.

    composition of substances, the ways in which their properties are related to their
    composition, and the interaction of substances to produce new materials. This subject
    occupies a central place among the sciences, it draws on the facts and theories of
    physics, and on mathematics for the tools necessary to evaluate and express quantitative
    chemical information. Chemistry in turn, provides terminology, facts, principles and
    methods that are essential to many aspects of other sciences. The applications of
    chemistry in fields such as agriculture, medicine, pharmacology, pharmacy, engineering and
    oceanography are numerous.  Mount Allison's undergraduate chemistry program is fully accredited by the Canadian Society for Chemistry (CSC).
    The program is designed to provide students with an education in the main branches of the subject,
    namely, analytical, inorganic, organic, physical and computational chemistry. The broad
    objectives of the Department are summarized in the following definition of education:  Education is learning to appraise data critically, to
    try to think up an intellectual framework, to be able to test it, to be able to marshal
    facts, to be able to write about them, to be able to communicate with people who may - and
    almost certainly will - have less knowledge of those facts than you have, because they
    will be asking you questions about them with a view to taking some action. (F. Dainton)  Students interested in pursuing a Major or Minor in Chemistry or Chemistry Honours, should
    consult the Departmental Website and a faculty member of the Department before completion
    of registration.  Disciplinary B.Sc. Programs  MINOR in Chemistry is 24 credits earned as follows:   6 from CHEM 1001, 1021 3 from MATH 1111 9 from Chemistry at the 2000 level* 6 from Chemistry at the 3/4000 levels   Note: *Where insufficient Chemistry courses are available at the 2000 level to
    fulfill this requirement, Chemistry courses at the 3/4000 levels may be substituted.
    Students cannot count CHEM 2511 towards a Minor.   MAJOR in Chemistry is 63 credits earned as follows:   6 from CHEM 1001, 1021 6 from MATH 1111, 1121 3 from MATH 2111, 2121, 2221 6 from BIOC 1001, 2001 6 from PHYS 1051, 1551* 12 from CHEM 2111, 2211, 2311, 2411 12 from CHEM 2121, 3231, 3321, 3421 3 from CHEM 3111, 3161, 3251, 3751, 4951, 4953 9 from Chemistry at the 3/4000 level, excluding CHEM 3161, 4951, 4953   Note: *It is recommended that Chemistry Majors take Physics 1551 in their first or
    second year.  Note: Additional 3/4000 level courses are needed to fulfill Calendar regulation 11.3.5   THE CHEMISTRY HONOURS PROGRAM  Students with a special interest in Chemistry and those who, after
    obtaining the B.Sc. degree, wish to continue their studies at the post-graduate level,
    should consider following the Chemistry Honours program. The courses required for the
    B.Sc. Chemistry Honours degree are all listed below. The required chemistry credits are
    ones that provide for study of the main branches of Chemistry in some depth. The required
    nine credits from Mathematics and the six credits from Physics give minimum background
    essential for work in Chemistry. Honours students are given a special opportunity to
    participate in chemical research with faculty members in the Thesis (CHEM 4990) course. This
    research is normally carried out in the summer months following the third year.   HONOURS in Chemistry is 81 credits earned as follows:   51 credits as in first 7 lines of Major, plus 21 from Chemistry at the 3/4000 level, chosen in consultation with the
          Program Advisor 3 from CHEM 4903 6 from CHEM 4990    CHEMISTRY LABORATORY WORK  Most Chemistry courses in the first three years have laboratory classes of
    about three hours
    duration each week as indicated in the course description.   GRADUATE STUDIES IN CHEMISTRY  The Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry offers a program of research courses
    leading to the Master of Science degree. The research interests in the Department are
    varied and further information can be obtained from the Department Head or from individual
    faculty members. The requirements for the M.Sc. degree are given in Section 11.4.
    Individual programs are arranged, depending on the student's background and
    interests.    CHEMISTRY COURSES  Note: The listing of a course in the Calendar is not a guarantee that the
    course is offered every year.  Note: Students must obtain a grade of at least C- in all courses used to

Ralph Mason Dreger  Professor
Emeritus of Psychology, Louisiana State University  and  Prof.
Irwin A. Berg  Professor Emeritus of Psychology, Dean (Retired), College of Arts &
Sciences, Louisiana State University       Raymond
Bernard Cattell      Raymond Bernard Cattell  (1905-1998)    Numerous psychologists from all over the world have
judged that Raymond B. Cattell was one of the half dozen greatest psychologists
of the twentieth century.? On the other hand, few psychologists have
engendered greater execration, and none, so far as we know, has been so
publicly humiliated by the organization representing American psychology
as was he.? What manner of psychologist and what manner of man was
this Cattell to receive such diametrically opposite judgments? There is little doubt that even Ray Cattell's enemies
would grant that he produced more in quantity of scholarly publications
than the vast majority of psychologists in this or any century.? They
might even concede that his innovative contributions exceed those of all
but a very few.? For sheer volume of books (50) from reputable publishers,
articles (well over 500) in juried journals, and widely-used measurement
instruments (at least 30 standardized tests) with their manuals or handbooks,
Cattell's productivity was exceptional.?? Although pertinaciously
pursuing a single programmatic aim of creating a series of tests for persons
from the preschool through adulthood and for groups large and small, questionnaires,
life-record, and ""objective"" tests (i.e., relatively unfakable ones, not
only questionnaires), the variety of fields upon which Cattell's research
impinges is astounding: educational and developmental, clinical, experimental,
social, individual difference, industrial, and statistical and mathematical
psychology; biology including genetics; medicine including psychiatry;
and scientific methodology. A sampling of Cattell's innovative contributions
(with his full acknowledgement of others' share in them), some of which
have been appropriated by scientists and scholars in disciplines beyond
psychology, provides evidence of his creativity (in which area, incidentally,
he did considerable research):?? r-sub-p, the coefficient of
profile similarity (taking account of shape, scatter, and level of profiles
of variable scores); P-technique factor analysis (for an occasion-by-variable
matrix); the Scree Test (using the curve of latent roots to judge the number
of factors); the Procrustes program (for testing an hypothesized factor
structure); the Taxonome program (for ascertaining the number and contents
of clusters in a data set); the Basic Data Relations Box (the dimensions
of experimental designs); the Dynamic Calculus (for assessing interests
and motivation); sampling of variables, as opposed to or in conjunction
with sampling of persons; group syntality (the ""personality"" of a group);
the personality sphere (the totality of factorial measurements of the personality);
fluid and crystallized intelligence (primarily genetically and environmentally
determined respectively); state and trait measurement (immediate and long-term
conditions); and Multiple Abstract Variance Analysis (MAVA) (with ""specification
equations"" embodying genetic and environmental variables and their interactions,
considered by H. J. Eysenck to be Cattell's greatest contribution). Various of these (and other) contributions of Cattell's
have not withstood the criticisms of qualified scientists, including some
who are his enthusiastic supporters.? The fact, however, that dozens
of psychologists from the United States and abroad sought his laboratory
at the University of Illinois to work collegially or under his supervision
attests to the wide influence of his ideas.? Probably more than any
other psychologist he introduced psychologists to multivariate methods,
especially but not limited to factor analysis. Cattell followed a custom that arose from his desire
to make psychology more scientific, but that custom also estranged him
from some psychologists.? Specifically, he used neologisms (e.g.,
dissofructance, ergic tension, corticalertia, commention) as the names
of variables.? He attempted to emulate the physical sciences, but
the neologisms seemed to confuse some people.? Besides, Cattell developed
what he called the ""Universal Index"" of factorial dimensions, with the
first elements, UI 1 to UI 16, representing the 16 factors of the 16PF
Personality Questionnaire and continuing at least through UI 36 to represent
subsequently-discovered dimensions for interest and motivation.? Because
not all psychologists are willing to memorize such indexes for the several
factors, what Cattell meant to emulate the periodic table as a means of
scientific communication proved to be a barrier to communication. After all is said, however, about Cattell's scientific
and scholarly contributions and the objections taken to his system, they
explain only in part the intensity of loyalty and of opposition to him
and his research.? His own responses to critiques of his research,
at times with successful refutations, are only part and parcel of the advances
of any science.? At other times, the vehemence with which his detractors
expressed their criticisms and the corresponding vehemence with which he
responded provide further explanation for the negative views expressed
by a portion of the observers of the Cattellian scene.? To explain
further the bipolar phenomenon, we consider R. B. Cattell, the man. Raymond Cattell was a gentle man and a gentleman,
appellations some of his foes would contest, for as mild as was his personal
persona, so fierce was his public one.? As host to guests, he was
both courteous and thoughtful, engaging in his converse, often diffident,
even hesitant, in expressing his views.? His colleagues freely admitted,
as one of them said, ""He exploited us for our own good.""? For the
most part, those who participated in his programmatic research delighted
in joining his team, though there seem to have been a few who resented
his exploitation. A learned man, Cattell was sufficiently fluent in
German to translate Kretschmer's The psychology of men of genius, and to
give some of his examination questions in both French and German.?
Ray's first book was ""Under Sail Through Red Devon,"" an account of his
sailing in the waters of Devonshire in a cayak-like, light-weight boat,
which could be paddled or sailed.? The book was dedicated to Monica,
his first wife, the mother of his son, Hereward (""Herry"").? Cattell's
knowledge of English literature was awesome.? He and one of the writers,
himself well-versed in that literature, challenged each other to identify
the title of some item of English literature, at which contest Cattell
proved to be somewhat the better. Of Cattell's sense of humor it seems that not many
of his circle of acquaintance were aware that on occasion he could dissolve
in laughter, not just smiles but real ""gut-busting"" boffos.? Cattell
and one of the writers of? this memorial would sometimes sing old
London Music Hall songs, all of them a bit bawdy.? During one visit,
when asked what a highland fling looked like, Cattell proceeded to demonstrate,
much to the delight of a Thai psychologist who was visiting at the time.?
Cattell also knew a number of spicy limericks which he would recite in
a clear voice when encouraged. One friend reported that Cattell spent an hour or
more telling of a month he spent living in a stone house that dated back
to Anglo-Saxon times.? He said that the walls were nearly four feet
thick.? It seemed to his hearer that Cattell found living in that
ancient house ""a kind of atavistic, mystical, experience."" One aspect of Cattell's work habits was his intense
concentration when he sat down to work.? He seemed to be oblivious
of anything else around him.? Then, when he was writing, he produced
a finished copy that needed little if any revision.? He seemed to
select the precise word immediately.? To be sure, the speed with which
he wrote (for he never used a typewriter, word processor, or computer)
necessitated a reader's best ""Wheel of Fortune"" skills to interpret.?
As for the quantity of such work, Dennis Child reported that when he (Child)
was at the Laboratory of Personality and Ability Testing at the University
of Illinois, Cattell would come in with a set of tapes which the typist
could not transcribe or others read fast enough before he brought in the
next day's set. Like some other psychologists, Cattell had scholarly
wives who collaborated in his research and writing, namely, A. Karen Schuettler,
mother of four of his children and a mathematician, who directed IPAT,
a test publishing house she and Cattell established; and Heather Birkett,
a clinical psychologist who wrote with him his last book on the 16PF. Thus, the man Cattell produced an image of a human
and humane, thoughtful, and dedicated scholar of a many-faceted personality
who drew to himself a goodly number who held a very high regard for him. On the other hand, his public persona sometimes produced
an opposite impression, especially when in conflict with those who disagreed
with him, exercising on them Saladin's scimitar at times and the Lion-Hearted's
broadsword at other times.? Certainly, some of his writings or public
utterances were not calculated ""to win friends and influence people"" in
his direction.? The co-editor of one of his major publications had
to soften the tone of Cattell's introduction to the volume, else as the
co-editor stated, ""He would have lost half his potential readers.""?
As Child, another co-editor, said, teaching was a ""'gradgrind'. It was
a distraction from the research fires burning within him.""? Thus,
Cattell did not enjoy the support of undergraduates who would later become
psychologists; indeed, he stated that the University of Illinois ""shielded""
him from teaching, especially undergraduates. Inasmuch as Cattell was facile with mathematics and
statistics, he fell into the custom that too many mathematics teachers
do of expressing disdain for those often otherwise highly intelligent persons
who did not (or could not, from their mathemaphobia) find mathematics easy.?
Those psychologists who could appreciate his mathematical skills were drawn
to him, but those who did not were often repelled.? In other ways
as well, Ray Cattell manifested an elitism which may have generated opposition
from some persons and support from others who were elitist-inclined. A few demographic facts may add to our understanding
of Cattell's multidemensional image.? He was born on March 20, 1905
in Staffordshire, England, of Norse, Scottish,? Irish and English
ancestry.? His father and one grandfather were independent engineer
designers; his mother Mary Fields Cattell.? He was one of three brothers,
the others being Cecil and Stanley.? Although Cattell passed the Cambridge
University entrance examination with first-class honors, he enrolled at
London University at age 16, receiving at age 19 his Bachelor of Science
degree in chemistry and physics, and later, he received his Master of Arts
in Education, and his Doctor of Philosophy (for GSR research), and Doctor
of Science, all from King's College, the University of London.? He
had, among others, Sir Cyril Burt and Charles Spearman as his mentors.?
Aside from building on Cattell's mathematical training for the ""hard sciences,""
Burt and Spearman were instrumental in fostering Cattell's strong interest
in psychological statistics and, particularly, factor analysis.? He
began his teaching career as lecturer in psychology at the University of
Exeter in 1927.? Then, from 1932 to 1937, he practiced clinical psychology
as director of the city of Leicester Child Guidance Clinic.? In 1937,
he was invited by E. L. Thorndike to be a research assistant at Columbia
University.? For a time, beginning in 1938, he was employed at Clark
University as G. Stanley Hall Professor of Genetic Psychology and then
became a lecturer in psychology at Harvard.? After World War II and
a period as a civilian consultant to the Adjutant General, War Department,
he began his lengthy tenure as Research Professor of Psychology at the
University of Illinois.? He remained at the University of Illinois
until his retirement in 1973, when he first removed to Boulder, Colorado,
and then to the University of Hawaii.? Cattell died in Honolulu, Hawaii,
on February 2, 1998. We emphasize that Cattell was not a fascist or racist
as some have claimed, but was an elitist.? To be sure, in his formative
days as a psychologist, his mentors and just about all white scholars assumed
the superiority of the white race.? Cattell even seemed to flirt with,
though quickly discarded, some of Hitler's notions about the superiority
of the Aryan ""race.""? These positions lingered on in some of his writings,
especially in his over-valuation of the ""IQ"" and the ""g"" factor.?
They were evidenced in his adopting a religio-philosophical ""Beyondism,""
which appeared to be the culmination of his almost dogmatic faith in evolution. Nevertheless, in correspondence with one of the writers
of this obituary Cattell eschewed racism; and in the final year of his
life he issued a clear public statement denouncing both racism and fascism.?
This statement was prompted by the occasion of his being proffered an Award
for Lifetime Achievement by the American Psychological Foundation, and,
then, having it ""postponed"" at the last minute because of threats of rioting
at the 1997 American Psychological Convention if it were to be presented.?
Some of Cattell's prior positions were used, sometimes quite unfairly,
to calumniate, even on the world-wide web, this remarkably talented and
productive psychologist. Fortunately, a host of psychologists from across
the world, not only his friends but many who differed from him on scientific
and scholarly grounds, rose to his defense upon hearing of the shameful
treatment accorded him.? Most if not all of these agreed with the
judgment expressed at the beginning of this obituary, that Raymond B. Cattell
was one of the half dozen greatest psychologists of the twentieth century. Ralph Mason Dreger Professor Emeritus

B. Straw and Deanne Bogdan. 113- 129. Portsmouth, New Hampshire: Heinemann-Boynton/Cook,
1993.  My teaching has changed a lot in the past few years,
and it seems that I spend a lot of time trying to explain, to myself as
well as to others, just what the changes amount to. The other day I heard
myself saying that the most important difference was that I was trying
to put meaning at the centre of all the written language used in connection
with my classes. The colleague I was talking to said that he didn't see
anything unusual about that -- what else, he asked, could possibly be at
the centre? I took a quick stab at answering the question, but I don't
think I convinced him I knew what I was talking about. It was in trying
to deal with that question for myself, later, that I discovered what's
really happened: my notion of what meaning itself is has changed. I no
longer think of it as something that's in texts or language: it seems to
me far more powerful and useful to think of meaning as a social event.
[ note ] Language as a Social Phenomenon  In recent years we've heard a lot about language as a social phenomenon.
We've been hearing it from the lips (and reading it from the wordprocessors)
of people in an amazing variety of disciplines and areas of research. Those,
like Kenneth Kaye ( 1982 ; Kaye & Charney, 1980 )
and Jerome Bruner ( 1983 ) who are concerned with
the very earliest beginnings of mental life in infants, have been telling
us that Vygotsky ( 1978 ; see also Wertsch, 1983 , 1986 )
was right when he said, a half century or more ago, that intelligence itself
was a social phenomenon, intimately connected with that most social of
phenomena, oral language. Those, like M. A. K. Halliday 1975 , 1978 ), who are concerned with the early stages
of oral language development, have been telling us that language is a social
semiotic, and not something that grows in the isolation of an individual
cognitive mechanism. Those, like Frank Smith ( 1982 ),
Jerome Harste (Harste, Woodward and Burke, 1984 )
and Judith Newman ( 1985 , 1986 , 1991 ), who are concerned with the development
of literacy in young children, have been telling us that written language
must be meaningful in order for it to be something children want, and are
able, to learn -- and that for language to be meaningful it must be the
vehicle for social transactions. Second language theorists like Stephen
Krashen ( 198l ) and teachers like Anne Freadman
( 1988 ) have been telling us that the best way
to learn a language is to use it in real social contexts, for genuine social
purposes. In composition studies, indeed, ""social process"" has become the
buzzphrase of the early nineties. Scholars like Karen Burke LeFevre ( 1987 )
and Jim Reither ( 1985 , 1990 ;
Reither and Vipond, 1989 ) have made it clear that
not only composition and revision, but invention itself is profoundly social.
Even in literary theory, the ""new pragmatics"" (Mitchell, 1986 ;
Kamuf, 1986 ; Hassan, 1987 )
and a dialogic view based on Bakhtin ( 1986 ;
see also Bialostosky, 1989 and Holquist, 1991 ) have begun to look as though they're
about to shoulder aside deconstruction and reader-response theory. And so at conferences we begin to make jokes about how often the word
""social"" can be allowed to appear in the program. We struggle to keep the
term from becoming so general, so widely used, that it no longer means
anything, the way the dichotomy between ""process and product"" did a few
years ago, or ""current-traditional paradigm"" did a few years before that,
or ""whole language"" is doing today. And we race to snatch the concept out
from under the dusty tread of all those people who want to appropriate
the term for the snappy, colourful covers of grammar drill books, freshman
comp handbooks, introductory English readers, language arts texts and literature
anthologies -- complete with study questions and a handy section on writing
about literature. In the short time we have before the term vanishes into the dust back
down the road behind the wagon train of progress, I'd like to suggest some
of the powerful implications it might still possess for the way we teach
reading and writing to be learned. These implications are easy to lose
sight of; but I think once we've lost them we're really not talking about
treating language as social any more. Once we've accepted that language is a social process, our notion of
what meaning is must change radically. It has been clear for some time
that traditional definitions are inadequate, of course. Michael Reddy ( 1979 ),
for example, pointed out the way using a ""conduit"" metaphor for describing
language leads us to think (wrongly) about language as a sluice down which
chunks of meaning, like pulp logs, are channelled from sender to receiver,
arriving essentially unchanged (the ERIC Bibliography used to offer ""information
transfer"" as a synonym for ""communication""). With reference to reading,
Frank Smith ( 1985 ) has called this the ""information-shunting""
model. According to that model, meaning isn't particularly problematic:
it is just information that is somehow contained in text. Our job as speakers
and writers is to get the information into the conduit; as listeners and
readers, to get it out. I don't mean to suggest anyone has ever thought
that this was simple: a whole generation of reading researchers, linguists
and psychologists of language worked at trying to construct a model of
just how that might work. But they didn't consider the question problematic;
it was just complicated. For a long time it seemed as though it would be
solvable in a purely mechanical way. In fact, many people still believe
they're going to succeed in creating a computer program that will parse
sentences into meaning, and generate new sentences with ""the same"" meanings
based on their ""deep structures."" It's been apparent from the beginning, though, that in at least some
cases the situation in which a particular syntactic structure was uttered
could determine its meaning, and do it without much help or interference
from the kinds of internal structures that a computer program could apprehend.
If you listen to any naturally occurring oral conversation for more than
two or three minutes, in fact, you discover that the meanings of the overwhelming
majority of oral utterances are in fact determined not by their semantic
properties and syntactic structures, but much more powerfully by a sort
of unspoken, continuously renegotiated social contract between the participants
in the conversation. ""That's just great,"" you might say. ""Tell me about it,"" I might reply. In an appropriate situation -- say we've just been informed that there's
going to be no overhead projector available for our conference presentation
in ten minutes, the one that depends on 40 transparencies of statistical
data and charts -- we both know that you certainly don't mean that it's
just great, and that I'm not asking you to tell me anything at all. How
do those sentences come to have those meanings? Although we might not all talk the same way about how those sentences
mean, it's clear that we would all share a sociolinguistic competence that
allows us to make the right sense out of them most of the time. But they
may not seem normal or typical sentences. For one thing, they're rhetorical
figures of some kind -- the first is obviously irony, and probably Aristotle
or Puttenham would have a name for the second. Thus, it might be argued,
they're not really ""standard language,"" not something we have to account
for if we want to explain how language works. Serious language, we might
argue, the kind we want to understand, works more directly than that, isn't
so situation-dependent, is more susceptible of analysis, and carries more
information. ""Tell me about it"" doesn't actually convey information, does
it? Wouldn't a philosopher of language like Bertrand Russell analyze it
right out of existence, showing that it's really not properly language
at all? Yes, he probably would. But there are two problems with that sort of
position. First, the kind of language we're considering is far from unusual.
Virtually all naturally occurring oral language is like that. And if you
want to account for, and understand, how language works, you can't very
well argue that seventy or ninety per cent of what you hear people saying
isn't really language at all, and therefore doesn't have to be accounted
for. Second, it's becoming increasingly clear that, both developmentally
and logically, the information-conveying aspect of language is built on
the foundation of these kinds of context-dependent, social-context-driven,
linguistic transactions (cf., for example, Halliday, 1975 ).
It's not conducted according to any syntactic-structural model of pure
information transfer. When information transfer occurs it's based on a
pre-existing foundation of that kind of transaction. A Conversational Model of Reading and Writing  Against the background of this rather elaborate argument, let me see
if I can now say what I've come to mean by ""meaning."" (It should be obvious
that I'm not going to say that it has a lot to do with information.) I
think it has a good deal to do with what sociolinguistics has taught us
to think of as ""point."" Most relevant here is the work of Labov ( 1972 )
and Polanyi ( 1979 , 1985 )
on the way conversational stories allow tellers and listeners to share
""points."" To state the insight I draw from their work as simply as possible:
when I recount an incident in a conversation, if you attend to what I say
as though it were a series of factual assertions to be remembered, you
generally lose the ""point"" utterly. My colleague Doug Vipond and I have
based much of our theory of literary reading on this study of what happens
when people tell stories in conversation (Hunt & Vipond, 1986 ). Over the past several years, we have been tinkering with a conceptual
model of the literary reading process (Hunt and Vipond, 1985 , 1991 ). I think this model yields a useful tool for
thinking about almost any language event (perhaps especially one involving
written language). What we suggest is that the nature of the reading process
is influenced by a range of variables which can be grouped into three categories:
the reader, the text, and the situation. Just as altering the text will
affect the nature of the process that occurs, and thus the kind of point
or meaning that may be constructed, so changing the reader, or the situation
in which the reading occurs, will equally affect that process and its outcome. The most obvious example, because it has been the most regularly explored,
is the text. A grocery list, for example, affords (but doesn't guarantee)
an information-centred reading, whereas a letter of apology for an inadvertent
insult would tend to promote (but, of course, again doesn't guarantee)
a socially engaged, point-driven reading. Altering the reader might make just as much difference. A shopper might
read the grocery list for information; but you, on the other hand, might
read it as a sign of the writer's mood or status; or someone else as a
coded message; or I might recognize it, on the counter next to the door,
as a subtle reminder that I'd forgotten to stop at the store on the way
home. You might be the recipient of the letter of apology and read it one
way -- but someone else, years later, might read it as an example of the
author's late-middle style, or of the use of capital letters during the
time period, or as evidence as to the facts in some irrelevant court case. Equally important -- and much less often considered -- is the situation
in which the reading occurs. I might encounter the grocery list in a book
of found or concrete poems, or the letter of apology as a text in a reading
comprehension test. A student might read the grocery list in the book of
poems as part of her cramming for a final exam in her English course. A
friend might hand me the text of the letter which he'd found in the reading
test, and say, ""That's exactly the way I feel."" Each of these situations
would, clearly, produce very different readings of the same text by the
same reader. The distinction I am making, clearly, is one which depends on seeing
a written language event as either having, or not having, the pragmatic
potential to establish, maintain, and deepen the social relations between
people which are what make up a culture. I have called the kinds of fragmentary,
inane, artificial, committee-constructed pieces of written language one
finds in textbooks and reading tests ""textoids"" (Hunt, 1989 );
Chris Anson has expanded the idea to suggest that readers and situations
may render texts otherwise whole and natural into textoids, devoid of human
purpose and ""stripped of their human richness and complexity"" ( 1986 :
21). Another way to phrase this is to use the distinction Bakhtin draws between
""text"" and ""utterance."" (This is, by the way, a quite different use of
the word ""utterance"" from that posited by David Olson [ 1977 ;
see also Luke, DeCastell & Luke, 1983 ].) Bakhtin,
in an essay probably written in 1952-53 [Holquist, 1986 :
xv], contrasts the set of words and syntactic structures used by someone
in a given situation (the text) with what the people in the situation actually
use the text for (the utterance). In the case of the example I used earlier,
the four words, ""Tell me about it,"" are the text: the utterance is quite
different in the situation I presented from what it is when the same string
of signifiers is used as an example in this paragraph -- and would be quite
different again when the four words occur in a new situation. Combining
my term and Bakhtin's distinction, it's possible to say that the texts
which resist being made into utterances -- whether because of the situation,
the users, or the string of signifiers themselves -- are textoids. Circumstances
in which no one is using the text as an utterance, as a vehicle for what
Bakhtin calls dialogue, create textoids. Language transactions which occur in such circumstances are, I am suggesting,
essentially without the kind of social meaning I've been describing. One
thing that is clearly important about such lack of meaning is that, as
I have argued elsewhere ( 1987 , 1989 ),
it makes it much more difficult for us to use to their full potential our
powerful language learning abilities and propensities. But whether one
accepts that argument or not, it is easy to agree that such transactions
are in some sense peculiar. What is not so easy to agree about, I think,
is that if we are looking for examples of language transactions which are
of that peculiar, sterile, meaningless kind, the best possible place to
find them is in school and university. I would contend, in fact, that the
written language events which occur in educational contexts are virtually
all like that. I should make clear here, by the way, that I'm not beating the dead
horse of drill-and-practice sheets, fill-in-the-blanks grammar exercises,
basal readers and comprehension questions. (That horse, although it's dead,
is not gone -- it's still out there roaming classrooms like a malignant
zombie.) What specifically concerns me here are my own (presumably enlightened)
practices as a teacher of English over the past twenty-five years, and
what seem to me to represent some of the best and most imaginative and
thoughtful strategies among my professional colleagues. When we examine
those assignments and those strategies in the light of this notion of meaning
as social event, I think that we discover some challenging truths, and
further, that some facts about student reading and writing that we've all
known and accepted with a good deal of equanimity for years take on a new
urgency. Teaching without Meaning  Let me consider an example from my own teaching. A few years ago I asked
an introductory literature class to read Hemingway's ""Hills Like White
Elephants"" and write their own responses to it. This was late in the course,
so they'd had time to learn, if they were ever going to, that this was
not a test, and that individual and peculiar responses would be valued
-- or at least would not be ""marked down."" Covertly, I was hoping to find
out how many students knew, before we discussed the story in class, that
the ""operation"" that's the implicit subject of the whole conversation between
the two Americans waiting at a railway station in Spain is an abortion.
More overtly, I was trying to help the students use their writing to explore
and extend their own understanding of the story before we discussed it
in class. The writing they handed in to me was appalling, of course (not more
appalling than usual, naturally, but still of a kind that you'd only ever
expect to see in a freshman literature class). What I saw at the time were
the disastrous handwriting; the incomplete and ungrammatical sentences,
the complete lack of transitions, the absence of any sense of direction
(or, indeed, of the existence of a reader out there beyond the page), and
the highly skilled evasion of the story's central issue. Based on those
papers -- virtually all of which amounted to highly general summaries of
the discussion between the two characters, and elaborately phrased and
entirely abstract value judgments about the artistic merit of the text
-- I absolutely could not tell whether any of them had constructed a point
for the story that was even remotely related to mine. My own had to do
with the impact of the sudden discovery of pregnancy on this carefree,
adolescent, Hemingway-style relationship. (In research since then, by the
way, I've discovered, based on samples of similar students, that it is
extremely unlikely that, in that situation, more than one or two of them
realized that the story was about an abortion.) I can no longer find that set of papers among my souvenirs, but virtually
any English teacher will be able to supply comparable sets from her own
experience (the classic description of this experience, of course, is Mina
Shaughnessy's [ 1977 ] account of the influx
of basic writers into her teaching). My conclusion then, and the conclusion
most of my colleagues have drawn from similar stacks of papers, was that
the students couldn't write, and in fact that when you came right down
to it they couldn't read either. It should not come as a surprise that I now think rather differently
about that situation. I now think that the problem wasn't a matter of the
students' capabilities at all, but something quite different. The situation
in which the students were acting was one which virtually guaranteed that
both their reading and their writing would be of the kind that I have been
describing as meaningless -- that is, completely disconnected from any
real social occasion or motive. First, the reading. The students were reading as part of an assignment.
Whatever I might say about the assignment (and at the time I didn't say
much), they knew that their job with school assignments was to read, decode,
store and remember. Most of the texts they had encountered in school, of
course, from basal readers to history and science textbooks, were really
textoids. They were not manufactured and created because someone had a
point she wanted to make to a real audience. They were created because
certain pieces of information had to be encoded in a language whose rhetorical
choices and limitations were determined not by readers and writers but
by readability formulas and the intense scrutiny of banks of editors, consultants,
censors and curriculum committees. But it's also true that even when ""real""
texts are encountered in school -- poems written by poets, stories written
by Hemingways, even (very rarely) expositions written by John McPhees or
Stephen Jay Goulds -- they are normally encountered in situations where
it's extremely difficult to treat them as anything other than textoids.
The possibility that the author, like the person across the table telling
a story, might be engaged in sharing values and inviting the reader to
make points, is obliterated by the fact that the story is in reality the
possession of, and is being offered to the student by, the textbook and
the teacher -- by the educational institution. It is not being offered
by its speaker or author. And it's being offered not as an utterance, but
as, in Anne Freadman's ( 1988 :7) phrase, ""an
example"" of something, a pretext for a test. Even more powerfully, the students knew (however cleverly I thought
I'd concealed it) that they were being tested. Everyone was, after all,
reading the same story -- obviously some would understand it ""better"" than
others. Whatever I might say about differences being okay had been said
to them by many teachers before me -- just as sincerely, and just as deceptively.
They knew there was a ""right answer"" and, furthermore, they knew that,
as always, the teacher was the person who had it. My illusion that I could
change a dozen year's worth of hard-learned lessons with a few weeks' exhortations
was not only ill-founded, it was also in an important way dishonest: there
was a right answer, and I did have it. It involved abortion. In the terms of the model of reading I described earlier, what we have
is a situation in which the text, for the right reader and in the right
situation, clearly would have afforded an engaged, pragmatic, dialogic,
""real"" reading for meaning. But the situation and the reader powerfully
pulled for an empty, asocial search for isolated chunks of information.
If I were to try to characterize the process of reading as it occurs in
such a situation, I might contrast it with what happens in a conversation,
or in a strongly meaning-oriented reading. If the speaker says something
incomprehensible you hold on to it and look (wait actively) for explanation,
on the assumption that the speaker is intending something -- you impute
coherent pragmatic intentions to the speaker. In a situation involving
what you see as a textoid, however, you make no such assumption and so
when something incomprehensible is encountered you simply pass it over
-- or, at best, you try to memorize it for the test. My first point about that assignment, then, is that -- primarily because
of the situation -- the reading that the students did was virtually guaranteed
not to have meaning at its centre. It would be a rare student who could
read the story in such a situation as though the story might have some
purchase on her, as though it were being told to her by someone who had
a reason for telling it and to whom it was possible to impute normal human
intentions. Such a student would be one with a highly developed ability
to ignore the real situation in favour of a fictional one, a student with
what I've come to call a powerful pragmatic imagination. Another way to
describe such a student is to say that she's already a reader. Still another
thing one might say about her is that she doesn't need much help from a
teacher. Now, writing. A second concern has to do with the potential role meaning
might play in the writing the students did on the basis of this reading.
What was it possible for them to mean in what they wrote? With whom could
they have been trying to make contact, and what values, structures of knowledge,
judgments of importance and patterns of expectation could they have been
trying to share? From their point of view, they could hardly expect to
have anything to say about the story. Having something to say is not easily
distinguishable from having someone to say it to, and in the view of those
students -- even after a few months' evidence of ignorance and incompetence
on my part -- I already knew everything there was to know about stories.
I was the teacher, after all. I could tell them -- I probably did tell them -- to write not as though
to me but as though to a general reader; I might even have specified a
general reader who had already read the story (to avoid long, pointless
summaries). But the ability to engage such a mythical rhetorical reader
in the active process of composition is a rare one. It requires the writer
to use that imaginary figure to decide, for instance, in specific instances
-- moments where, to use James Britton's phrase (Britton, et al., 1975 ),
the language is being shaped at the point of utterance -- precisely how
much reference to the events of the story is necessary for that reader,
and what inferences that reader can be called upon to make, which ideas
can be backgrounded, or treated as ""given,"" and which need to be foregrounded
and treated as ""new."" It requires the kind of powerful pragmatic imagination
that a very few students -- the readers and the writers -- have managed
miraculously to retain. Very few of my students -- then or now -- have
it. It's hard to imagine where they might have acquired it, other than
in the sort of uncommon home where -- as Gordon Wells ( 1986 , 1987 ) has demonstrated so clearly -- attitudes
toward books and language create writers and readers. A resource which a skilled writer often turns to in such a situation
is her knowledge of how writing of the kind she's trying to produce sounds.
Rather than using the real situation to generate purposes and readers,
she uses the kinds of audiences which have been ""invoked"" (in Ede and Lunsford's
[ 1984 ] useful term) by other, similar texts as a
model. But my students had never in their lives read anything like what
I was asking them to write -- like, that is, the sort of thing teachers
had increasingly been asking them to write throughout their school careers.
No wonder they didn't produce such great texts -- and no wonder they didn't
learn very much that was of use to them from the exercise. Everything about
the situation virtually forced them to treat the text they were reading
as a textoid, and to produce textoids in response to my assignment. Meaning,
in the sense of social engagement or the sharing of structures of evaluation
and understanding or ""point,"" was just about entirely absent from the situation.
They didn't read for meaning, or write to convey it. Nor, not at all incidentally,
did I read what they wrote for its meaning: I read it to find out what
they knew -- a completely different matter -- and to assess their ability
to write. The absence of meaning, motive, and social context from this sort of
literacy event is made more dramatic if we contrast it to the kinds of
events described by Lee Odell and others who have been studying writing
in the workplace in recent years ( 1985 ; Odell
& Goswami, 1982 ). When Odell asked insurance
executives to explain the rhetorical choices they'd made in business letters
and memos, he discovered an astonishing (astonishing to many of us academics,
anyway) metarhetorical awareness and an equally surprising ability to articulate
reasons for subtle choices. Why? It seems to me clear: because there were
real motives and real readers, and real consequences. Just as Vygotsky's
( 1978 ) infant learns what a gesture means by
having it taken as a gesture, so Odell's businessmen (I infer) had learned
what the impact of certain kinds of phrases and organizational patterns
were because they'd seen them have that impact. They were used to dealing
with written texts as though -- in the terms I've been using here -- they
were written and read for meaning. If it is true that there are profound and fundamental differences between
the processes of reading and writing when conducted as empty exercises
and when conducted for meaning (as I am defining it), then it seems to
me that most of the adventurous and exciting theoretical and practical
work that's been done in recent years in composition and in the teaching
of literature may be pretty much beside the point. Separated from what
I'm calling meaning, language itself becomes an empty, pointless exercise. In the absence of pre-existing intention and audience, planning tends
to become the sort of perfunctory outlining we've all come to recognize
(""Teacher tells us we have to have an outline, so I always do one after
I've written the essay""); and invention a kind of meandering ooze of wordage
(""prewriting""). In the absence of authentic situation, purpose and reader,
revision tends to become an aimless and pointless alteration, a sort of
syntactic Brownian motion. In the absence of pragmatic context and intention,
reading tends to become a passive act of decoding and storage, and interpretation
and response tend to wander into an endless maze of free association and
unfettered fantasy. ""Analysis of poems"" in English classes is often this
sort of exercise. Unless the making of social meaning is at the centre, none of these
activities is likely to provide much opportunity for learning how to handle
language when it is at the centre. Even more seriously, I think, the predominance
of these kinds of activities in educational institutions tends to inculcate
one lesson very powerfully: written language, especially in academic settings
(which should, I think, be seen as the peculiar case, rather than Odell's
writing in nonacademic settings), does not have meaning at its centre. Alternatives  The obvious question to be raised at this point is whether there is
any genuine, practical alternative to the present situation. Is there a
way, within the limits set by the institutional contexts teachers work
in, to create situations win which student reading and writing is, in these
terms, meaningful? If there is no alternative, what I'm arguing might be
a theoretically interesting viewpoint, but would in practice amount to
little more than a depressing and self-indulgent orgy of woe-crying and
nay-saying. Having said all that, I don't imagine you'll be surprised to discover
that I believe there are alternatives. The ones I know most about are the
ones occurring among some of my colleagues at St. Thomas, and I'd like
to describe a couple of specific examples of alternative ways of structuring
learning, ways that hold, I think, real promise for addressing some of
the problems I've been describing1. The basic strategy is something we've begun calling "" Collaborative
Investigation."" In general, it entails creating a situation in which the
class organize themselves into a team to investigate cooperatively some
specific topic, using writing as the fundamental tool for that organizing,
that investigating, and that cooperation. Here is one example of how that
works in practice. I'm going to describe it as concretely as I can and
hope you can see some of the ways in which the reading and writing is done
in a situation which makes them rather different from more conventional
models. I usually require my introductory literature class to attend a number
of plays on campus or at the local professional theatre during the year.
One year (after we'd conducted for our own information a couple of collaborative
investigations of productions we were going to see) I suggested that we
prepare what we wound up calling a ""Playgoer's Guide"" to an upcoming professional
production of Lillian Hellman's The Little Foxes. We began by getting hold
of a copy of the play and reading it. We didn't order 29 copies of a text;
we shared library copies. We even shared the reading -- by having groups
read and present different parts of the play. We then generated questions
about the play, Hellman, and the production. In this case, we did this
by asking everyone to write down as many questions as they could in fifteen
or twenty minutes; the class then formed into groups to read each others'
questions and select a few to write on the blackboard. Then we edited and
selected among those, and set up ad hoc groups to go to the library and
find out what they could about particular questions -- regarding, for instance,
Lillian Hellman's life, the composition of the play, its historical background,
its previous productions, and so forth. (I went as well.) Each group prepared
a short, concrete report (sometimes these took the form of a set of separate,
individual reports; in other cases they were researched and written in
collaboration). Each of these reports was photocopied and in class the
next week each of a new set of groups received a sheaf of documents which
included a copy of each of those first reports. They read and discussed
them, and generated a new set of questions. Again these were written on
the board, edited and discussed, and assigned to groups, which took the
relevant reports, with their lists of references, and went back to the
library to prepare further additional or elaborative reports. The second round of reports were also photocopied. We spent part of
a class session arriving at a consensus as to what should go in the final
handbook, and set up groups to combine various reports into sections of
the handbook. These sections were finally edited by other groups, and then
given to a secretary (me, as it happened) to be typed into a computer file,
typeset, laid out, and printed. The final handbooks were distributed in
multiple copies to the class and left around the university a day or so
before the play opened -- they were, I might add, snatched up more rapidly
than I could photocopy them, and many of my students reported instances
of being thanked for their work by people they hardly knew, who'd picked
up copies somewhere. The final part of the process involved everyone in class writing a review
of some aspect of the play. The reviews were read by everyone else in class,
formed the basis of a discussion, and were then jointly edited by five
groups into separate consensus reviews, which we photocopied and sent to
the publicity director of the theatre company. It may be important to point out that I was not the first or only or
final reader of any piece of writing produced in this process; I did not
mark, comment on or edit any piece of writing (except that because I was
secretary I ran a spell checker on the final copy). There were no papers
which were essays on, or interpretations or analyses of, the play. And
it is certainly important to make clear that the document that was finally
produced is far from wonderful -- it's scrappy, sometimes superficial and
in at least one case erroneous. But -- like the texts produced on the way
to it -- it is clearly an authentically functional piece of written text.
And it was obvious to everyone involved that without the social interaction
structured by all those intermediate texts, it would have been impossible
to accomplish the final task or learn what we learned about Hellman and
her play. Perhaps more important, in every case rhetorical decisions were
made, at the point of utterance, in the light of obvious, real demands:
the writers knew who would be reading this, and how much they knew -- and
even, to some extent, how they felt about it. There are a variety of other ways in which the reading and writing that
students do in connection with their learning can be made more obviously
and practically functional, more clearly something written and read for
meaning rather than in order to demonstrate competence or exercise rhetorical
skills. This is simply one fairly recent example; the classes of some of
my colleagues at St. Thomas would offer a wealth of others. Many whole
language classes engaged in what Frank Smith ( 1988 )
-- and John Dixon before him (Dixon & Stratta, 1984 )
-- call ""enterprises"" offer still more. What is most important is that
such strategies are not difficult to come up with, once one has embraced
the basic notion -- that the way to create a context in which students
are writing and reading for meaning is to put the writing and reading into
situations where they serve purposes which the students can see as real
and which they can adopt as their own. The danger, of course, is that once
you've embraced that notion, there isn't any going back: the changes and
the discoveries acquire their own momentum. You get hooked. I didn't tell that to my colleague who wanted to know what I was trying
to say about putting meaning at the centre of my teaching. But now at least
I've finally figured out for myself what it was I was trying to say. Whether
I can hook him remains to be seen.  References  Anson, Chris M. ""Reading, Writing, and Intention."" Reader , No. 16 (Fall, 1986): 20-35. Bakhtin, Mikhail Mikhailovich. Speech Genres

227,http://www.stthomasu.ca/~hunt/converse.htm,Learning to Converse with Texts - St. Thomas University,www.stthomasu.ca,"   Learning to Converse with Texts:  Some Real Readers, Some Real Texts, and the Pragmatic
Situation  Russell A. Hunt   [as published in SPIEL: Siegener Periodicum zur Internationalen
Empirischen Literaturwissenschaft Jg. 8 (1989), Heft 1: 107-130]    ""Mit Texten Kommunizieren Lernen: Einige Reale Leser, Einige Reale
Texte und die Pragmatische Situation""  Die Annahme, die Pragmatik gesprochener Sprache sei f?r das
Lesen ""literarischer"" Texte oder f?r das Verstandnis der Entwicklung
solchen Lesens irrelevant, hat in drei verschiedenen Kontexten -- Literaturtheorie,
Psychologie, und (am wichtigsten) P?dagogik -- zu Schwierigkeiten
gef?hrt, literarisches Lesen zu verstehen und zu erkl?ren, und
f?hrt deshalb heute zu ?berlegungen, grundlegende Annahmen zu
ver?ndern. Neuere Untersuchungen mit Methoden, die es erm?glichen,
pragmatische Aspekte von Leseprozessen zu beobachten, begr?nden vor
allem die Hypothese, solches Lesen eher als soziale Transaktion denn als
kognitiven Proze? anzusehen. Bietet man n?mlich Lesern Texte
in ihrer tats?chlich veroffentlichten Gestalt und nicht als f?r
Experimentierzwecke pr?parierte Artefakte an, und f?hrt man ""diskurs-orientierte
Interviews"" durch, so stellt man fest, da? manche Leser anders damit
umgehen, als es gew?hnlich in experimentellen Untersuchungen der Fall
ist. Das gilt besonders f?r das Verst?ndnis der Entwicklung hoherer
Lese- und Schreibf?higkeiten und damit f?r die p?dagogische
Praxis.     Most people concerned with language and how it works, and how we learn
to use it, have at last succumbed to the temptation (or the necessity)
to agree that it cannot be understood or accounted for ""when,"" as Dewey
and Bentley phrased it forty years ago, ""a word's meaning is severed from
the word's actual presence in man's behavior, like a sort of word-soul
from a word-body"" (1949: 109). In other words, we've agreed that language
cannot be understood without taking into account its pragmatic component.
Even many of us whose central interests are in what might be termed the
development of ""literary"" literacy have accepted that anything we might
label a work of literature must be considered and understood as social
discourse, rather than merely as a pure aesthetic object or an unproblematic
""container"" for images, ideas, stories or ""meanings"" -- and thus that we
must, as Bakhtin suggested, open up ""written texts to the kind of give
and take usually thought to obtain only between two people engaged in conversation.""
(Clark & Holquist, 1984:152). Even so, it is still common, even among those whose aim is to emphasize
the role of social interactions and the interpersonal functions of language
-- pragmatics -- in literary activity and learning, to add hastily that
we don't really mean to suggest that written language is very much like
oral language. Consider this formulation, for example: It is more than legitimate to question the pertinence of many pragmatic
presuppositions for the analysis of literature. Even a minimal definition
of the pragmatic project engages aspects of the communication situation
which are not properly part of the text- object: questions of producer's
meaning, and of situational context, for example, have long since been
expurgated from literary consideration, or simply do not form part of the
communicative situation. Moreover, the formal definition of these pragmatic
components of communication being as yet far from rigorous, the application
to literature remains a somewhat dubious enterprise, open to the criticism
of metaphorization. (Randall, 1985:416). The assumptions underlying that would, I think, be regarded by most
people as pretty unexceptionable. This particular example occurs in the
context of the discipline of literary theory, but I believe that a position
very like it would be taken for granted by people in most of the fields
I know of having to do with language. I have become increasingly convinced
in recent years, however, that such a categorical distinction, by which
some questions ""have long since been expurgated from . . . consideration,""
is ill-founded. Worse, its widespread acceptance has had profoundly damaging
effects. These effects are perhaps particularly destructive to the processes
whereby individual literacy develops -- from the child's first recognition
of the semiotic potential of environmental print (Goodman & Altwerger,
1981; Harste, Woodward & Burke, 1984) to the adult reader learning
to cope with the elaborate dance of an Italo Calvino -- or a Shakespeare
-- and to our understanding of those processes. There are three realms in which I think the effects of accepting such
a view of written language has had unfortunate effects: roughly, we can
call them psychology, literary theory, and education. First, our attempts to bring to bear the knowledge and strategies of
psychology in order to understand how written language works -- and particularly
how the most complex and rich forms of written language are produced and
comprehended -- have been dominated by the kind of work which concerns
the reading of fragmentary or trivial or synthetic texts (isolated words
flashed by a tachistoscope, or ""reading test texts,"" or ""stories"" written
to embody certain arbitrary characteristics) in peculiar circumstances
(with one's head locked in a frame and an infrared beam bouncing off one's
eyeball, or reading from a CRT in a laboratory, with instructions to remember
as much as possible). Fundamental problems with such work have been pointed out by figures
like Beaugrande (1980, 1987) and Bleich (1984). It is focused on creating
mechanical processes which might emulate the logic of reading (e.g., Gough,
1972; LaBerge & Samuels, 1974, 1977), or concerned with how text structure
affects what people remember (e.g., Meyer, 1975), or it concerns how people
process, understand and remember artificially constructed or simplified
""stories"" (e.g., Rumelhart, 1975; Mandler & Johnson, 1977; van Dijk,
1980), or, as Kintsch & Vipond (1979) point out, it aims at evaluating
texts for ""readability."" It is extremely rare for this empirical work to concern itself with
the reading of authentic, whole texts in non-laboratory or potentially
""dialogic"" situations (Hoppe-Graff & Schell, 1988). As Beaugrande (1987:56)
points out, ""So far, most psychologists who have used texts rather than
word lists or isolated sentences have preferred non-literary samples of
narrative and expository discourse""; and, as Larsen and Seilman (1987)
observe, the texts which psychologists synthesize are usually ""lousy stories.""
Such work is easily caricatured as studies of the processing of what I
have called ""textoids"" (Hunt, 1989). And while it offers some interesting
analogies to things readers in authentic, real situations might be doing,
I believe that the reading it is focused on is fundamentally different
from the kind of reading with which we should be primarily concerned, and
that its methodological strategies preclude the possibility of conversation
between reader and text. In the area of literary theory, the situation is more complex. At least
two of the principal kinds of activity in which a practicing literary scholar
might be engaged embrace as fundamental assumptions the kind of separation
Randall assumes between written text and pragmatically embedded text. In order to facilitate the continuing production of new interpretations
of canonical works and writers (e.g., Hunt, 1975), it has been useful (if
not, indeed, necessary) to rule out of bounds ""questions of producer's
meaning, and of situational context."" This has meant, in practice, the
treatment of literary works as though they had no authors, contexts, and
intentions, and as though their readers (when they are considered at all)
were acting in a space quite separated from the world of practical action,
reading in a text museum, with ""that distinter[est]ed contemplation, which
according to Adorno's argument in his essay on Beethoven's Missa Solemnis ,
neutralizes art and casts it deliberately into a useless limbo"" (Sanguinete,
1967:393). Similarly, the continuing elaboration of literary theory as an end in
itself, a complex and often brilliant intellectual exercise, is one which
I (and, of course, many others) have questioned as, in the course of keeping
literature separate from workaday considerations, abdicating ""responsibility
to what might be called the social question of the humanities"" (Goodheart,
1983:468), if not as self-regarding and self-indulgent (cf. Eagleton, 1983:
Mitchell, 1986; Kamuf, 1986: Hunt, 1987b, in press b). Most immediately and practically, it seems that these activities assume,
and foster, an attitude toward literature as a special and different kind
of language, a set of texts (in the case of interpretive criticism) or
practices (in the case of theory) which have no practical consequences
whatever, which exist in the realm of purely aesthetic experience and purely
intellectual contemplation. Pratt's convincing argument (1977) that ""literary""
texts do not differ from other texts in any linguistically definable way
is countered (if acknowledged) by saying that the difference is in the
way such texts are treated. In Archibald MacLeish's once-celebrated formulation,
""A poem should not mean / But be."" It should be clear that these are serious problems only from certain
particular standpoints. If you assume that literature and its criticism
and theory should be socially engaged (cf. Lentricchia [1983], for instance)
you will be concerned about this separation of literature from ""ordinary
language"": if not, it will not seem a problem. It is clear that many literary
professionals would not share my concern. It is more common to find concern for such issues among those who think
of themselves primarily as teachers. And indeed, in my view the arena in
which these assumptions have had the most important effects is that of
language development and education. As a literature teacher, it has seemed
to me for some time that to treat literature in the way that literary theory
and psychology insist we must is to render it innocuous (Hunt, in press
a) and unengaging and -- most important -- to teach the tacit lesson that
written language in general is a sterile and empty exercise rather than
an immediately socially useful tool like oral language (Hunt, 1989). Further,
and worse, if Vygotsky (1986: see also Wertsch, 1986: Forman & Cazden,
1985) was right that it is through our using language in authentic, socially
embedded ways that language comes to be for us a tool for thinking -- indeed,
becomes thought itself -- disengagement of this powerful and rich kind
of language from immediate social motives and concerns is to render it
less accessible as such a tool. Even though work on literacy done in the context of educational interests
often seems more relevant to such concerns (cf. especially Smith [1982]
and Goodman [1982]), it tends to be most often focused on reading that
occurs among young and learning readers and in school situations, and on
reading in order to learn facts and information or, at best, to write formal
interpretive essays on literature (e.g., Purves & Rippere, 1968). Again,
such motives for reading, while related to the situation in which students
actually find themselves, might characterize only the kind of reading done
in schools. It is at least plausible that the class room context is as
inauthentic, and produces a reading as different from ""real"" reading, as
what might occur in reading laboratories, under the watchful eye of an
experimenter with a stopwatch. If in fact there were no reason to think that the separation of pragmatic
texts from aesthetic ones was ill founded in fact, of course, any suggestion
that it is educationally and theoretically counterproductive to accept
the separation would have to be dismissed as flying in the face of experience.
However, in recent years I have come to think that the separation does
not actually adequately describe what readers do. Although there are increasingly strong suggestions in other areas that
such a separation is difficult to maintain, my own convictions about this
derive from my involvement in research into literary reading. Let me quickly
summarize that work, stressing the implications for thinking about the
similarities and connections between socially embedded uses of language
and those we have come to think of as ""aesthetic."" About five years ago my colleague Douglas Vipond (in collaboration with
whom all my work in reading study has been done) and I began an attempt
to find out more than seemed known about what happens when people read
literature. Our basic research question could be phrased as having three
components: What do (1) actual people do when they read (2) ""literary""
texts in (3) authentic or ""naturally occurring"" situations? We were convinced
that the basic research strategies had to be empirical. We wanted, not
the results of introspection into our own reading processes (though we
have done that) nor the results of abstract theory building (though we've
done that as well), but rather observable data that might be subject to
intersubjective verification. We also wanted our studies to reflect what
readers did with authentic texts in actually occurring situations -- that
is, it was our attempt to generate real readings, and not professional
readings, or ""student-style"" ""learn from text"" tasks. At first we used traditional experimental and quantitative (statistical)
strategies. Our earliest studies (e.g., Vipond & Hunt, 1984; Hunt &
Vipond, 1986) involved, for instance, more than 250 readings (primarily
by university freshmen) of short stories (most were of John Updike's widely
anthologized story, ""A & P""). We used various strategies in an attempt
to discover what was going on behind the silence of our readers. We tape
recorded, coded, and quantified oral protocols. We taped readers explaining,
during the reading, their choices between various ""branches"" of the text
in which alternative continuations were presented. We taped, coded, and
quantified protocols from retrospective interviews (particularly from responses
to ""probes,"" or things we told readers had been said about the stories
by other readers). We kept records of the time it took readers to read
various sections of the stories. We used various devices to ascertain what
readers noted while reading and remembered after reading. The basic findings
from this reasonably traditional sort of research led us to posit three
different modes of reading. It seemed to us that each instance of reading
we studied could be categorized as predominantly guided and shaped by one
of three sets of purposes or intentions. We have described these categories
elsewhere at some length, so here I will merely sketch them.  information-driven reading: when this mode of reading is dominant, the
reader's overriding purpose is to acquire information from the text. It
is similar to what Rosenblatt (1938) has called ""efferent"" reading, in
that it is the reader's main intention to ""carry something away"" from the
text.  story-driven reading: in a situation where this mode is dominant, the reader's
overriding purpose is to be engaged in a story-world, to imagine the world
as fully as practicable and to treat its characters and events in a way
parallel to how those characters and events would be treated were they
real. The readers of romances described by Radway (1984) seem normally
to engage in this kind of reading.  point-driven reading: in a situation dominated by this mode, a reader's
central purpose is not to identify and remember facts, nor to live through
the vicarious experience; rather it is to be engaged with the text as discourse,
in a way which seems to be very similar to how, in conversation, we attend
to oral stories (cf. Labov, 1972; Polanyi, 1985; Tannen, 1984). We expect
the discourse to be, in Labov's terms, ""pointed""; we think that the teller
probably has a comprehensible reason for uttering this discourse, and that
that reason will probably be socially relevant. Accordingly, we treat information
and events as subordinate to such purposes, and look for shared ""evaluations""
(Labov, 1972; Polanyi, 1979) embedded in the text by an intending author.  This work also led us to believe that which of these three modes is predominant
in a given instance of reading (or at given moment during a reading) is
not a matter that is determined in a simple way. Rather, it is the outcome
of a complex transaction (in the sense defined by Dewey and Bentley, 1949;
see also Vipond & Hunt, 1988) between three kinds of influence. It
is not, that is, simply a matter of what the reader ""decides,"" or, less
directly, a function of the reader's habits, background, expectations and
knowledge. Nor is it a matter of a text determining how it must be read
or even -- as Eco has proposed -- telling you that ""you cannot use the
text as you want, but only as the text wants you to use it"" (1979:9). As
Rosenblatt (1969, 1985) has suggested, each transaction with text is in
important ways unique, occurring not only between one reader and one text,
but also in one particular situation. Some ways in which the three influences
might transact with each other (and thus prevent us from ever understanding
any one? specific instance of one of them outside the context of its
relations with specific instances of the others) can be illustrated briefly,
adapting the idea of ""affordance"" from James J. Gibson's (1979) theory
of ""ecological"" perception. First consider the text. It would seem, for instance, that a text such
as a telephone book or a copy of Books in Print must have characteristics
that ""push"" readers toward reading it in an ""information- driven"" way.
But the only way we can know that it has such characteristics is that people
in fact usually do read it in such ways -- in practice, that is, it appears
to ""afford"" such reading. It is, however, clearly conceivable that a certain
reader in a certain situation might read the telephone book for other reasons
than to take away a number -- read it to share the values of the telephone
company, for example, or read part of it which had been ""framed"" as a ""found
poem"" (and thus as presented or authorized by someone to share values other
than those of the telephone company). Or consider, at the other end of
the spectrum, a modernist text such as Italo Calvino's If on a Winter Night
a Traveler -- or even an almost traditional story like ""A & P."" Such
a text may ""afford'"" a reading whose aim is to ""make contact"" with a speaker
or author in an immediately social way, to share evaluations and understandings
with that real or imagined person; but, obviously it can also be read for
a vicarious experience of an imagined story world or -- as Louise Rosenblatt
(1938) first pointed out -- efferently, as a source of facts and propositions
and information to be acquired and remembered. What the text ""is,"" above
the level of a particular set of black marks on a white page, is determined
by how it is read, which is a function of the reader and the situation. Similarly, it might be expected that a given reader, as Norman Holland
(1976, 1985) or David Bleich (1975, 1978) have argued, unilaterally determines
the nature of the transaction in any given instance, bringing to bear on
the experience her own preconceptions, expectations, abilities and habits
as a unique person -- a student, a habitual reader, a habitual non-reader,
a professional, or whatever -- pretty much regardless of the nature of
the text. Yet it can be observed, in practice, that some texts actually
are usually read in certain predictable ways, and that some situations
do affect in principled ways how readers act. Further, investigation of
the ways in which readers' concepts of literature and views of themselves
as participants in the social systems organized around literature affect
their reading (e.g., Meutsch and Schmidt, 1985; Meutsch, 1987, in press)
also make clear that a reader's activity is profoundly affected by her
more general social position and role. And finally, the situation -- both the larger social situation and,
more specifically, the immediate physical and social context (the classroom,
the laboratory, a testing situation, a living room; a text is issued by
an institution or offered by a friend) -- plays a role in the way a reader
will act in reading. But, again, this role is not a simply defined one:
situations which an observer might think of as ""the same"" will be perceptually
constructed by different readers in radically different ways, and will
thus affect the reading of even the same texts in different ways. All of this can be understood as merely an attempt to stipulate as many
consequences as possible of saying that any instance of reading is, and
thus can only be comprehended as, a transaction. The process of generalizing
about reading is, as we came slowly to understand, far more complex than
we had expected. But as we struggled to understand our results, the pattern
I have just described emerged as a conceptual frame which seemed to us
to begin to account for them. It was clear, however, that the broad categories of reading we identified,
and the general patterns we saw among the entities we had identified as
fundamental, all might be subject to a great deal more analysis. If there
were differences between what a reader was doing when she was driven mainly
by the desire to acquire information and when her intention was to participate
in construction of evaluations and points, what -- specifically, operationally
-- were they? If which of these she does is subject to the influence of
the situation, what elements of situations might be salient to which readers
and which texts? We decided that the most immediate question had to do
with the nature of point-driven reading, which seemed to us to be the kind
of reading typical of readers engaged most fully with ""literary"" texts.
Thus our new question became: can we refine the notion of ""point-driven
reading""? In what way is it, for example, personal or social in the sense
which might be suggested by the analogy with conversational listening?
This question was not one we had been eager to ask. For one thing, it was one which it seemed to me implicitly questioned
many assumptions of the literary theory with which I was familiar. There
was reason to think reading should not be personal in this sense, reason
based not only on the assumptions of the New Criticism I had grown up with
(Wimsatt & Beardsley, 1954), but also on those of deconstruction and
most other current literary theory, which have argued that literature is
separate, aesthetic, private, and irrelevant to ""authorial intention"" and
thus not to be seen to be seen as a social transaction in this sense. It was also one which ran counter to some fundamental assumptions of
psychological reading research, which offered reason to hope it wouldn't
turnout to be social in this sense, partly because language processing
must be separable from immediate social circumstances and goals (or else
it becomes impossible to study by traditional psychological means). And finally, it seemed to contradict some of the traditional assumptions
of educational research and practice, which assumed that reading was a
set of decontextualized cognitive skills, and learning was a process of
acquiring information and ""facts"" which existed somehow ""out there,"" prior
to and separate from the educational context. In spite of this, it seemed to us we were driven inexorably to investigate
the possibility that when readers were reading texts they deemed ""literary,""
-- or, as Schmidt (1989) describes it, participating in the social system
organized around literature -- they were often reading in ways that could
be closely analogized to the way they might participate in a conversation.
And indeed, the more we thought about the question, the more it seemed
we could focus it precisely by looking at specific aspects of conversational
interaction. To what extent can we say that a point-driven reader is acting
as though she were in a conversation? Can we say it at all? What does it
mean and entail to say it? Does it mean that she is engaged in a pragmatic
transaction with another person? That she makes the same assumptions, employs
the same comprehension strategies, and embraces the same social goals --
that, in other words, she's trying to do the kinds of things that sociolinguists
tell us (and that we know intuitively) participants in conversation are
trying to do -- to ""make contact,"" to share what Labov and Polanyi call
evaluations, to say ""I think this is funny, I think that is bizarre, I
think this is surprising and that is appropriate and that is outrageous""?
Is that what these readers seemed to be doing? Were such readers sensitive
to evaluations? Did they impute motives to a hypothetical ""author""? Did
they attempt to create and negotiate situationally relevant points? How
did people learn how to do this, and why did so many seem not to learn
it at all? In an attempt to explore these questions we were forced to come up with
what was for us a new, more ""ecologically sensitive"" research strategy.
Such ""naturalistic"" strategies are commonplace, of course, in many other
areas of investigation, as Lincoln & Guba (1985) and Guthrie &
Hall (1984) have pointed out. We decided to work with a greatly reduced
number of readers, and try to put them in situations which were far less
controlled and structured, and to examine the readers' activities and statements
for regularities and patterns in the areas with which we were concerned.
As Rubin (in press) has phrased it, we were prepared to trade control for
regularity. Another consideration is one Andringa (in press) has explained
elegantly: it seemed that if we were interested in literary reading, it
was contrary and inconsistent to continue to insist on statistically ""averaging
down"" to a mean, when what we were really concerned with was the creative,
the individual, the unique, drawn from various departments within the university
-- not including literature departments, because while the sort of ""professional""
reading that often characterizes such readers is clearly of interest, it
poses problems we preferred to postpone. We asked each of these readers
to read four complete texts. Each reader was interviewed over a four hour
period (divided into two hour sessions, separated by a few days). In each
case, the reader read a text, had a conversation with our interviewer about
it, and then read another. At the end of the two-part session, they talked
about the whole experience and went back to the individual texts for final
comments and wrapup. We attempted to make the physical situation as comfortable
for the readers as possible by giving them an upholstered chair and incandescent
lighting and so forth, and by handing them the text so that it was in their
possession: further, our interviewer busied himself with other work in
another corner of the room while they read. The interview itself was only
semi-structured: the interviewer primarily tried to get the reader to say
as much about the reading as possible (for a fuller description of this
study, see Vipond, Hunt, Jewett & Reither, in press). The sessions
were tape recorded and transcribed, and then read and reread, by the participants
and the interviewer as well as the experimenters, looking for patterns
among readers and within readings -- and particularly, on the experimenters'
parts, for evidence of the kinds of engagement which it seemed to us might
typify ""point-driven"" reading. One aspect of the method seems worth commenting on at some length here,
because of the way in which it opened up an unexpected aspect of the reading
to our observation. The texts were not presented as dot-matrix printed
""experimental texts,"" or on computer screens, or even as photocopies: the
readers were handed the actual publications in which the texts had appeared,
e.g., a commercially published book that someone might buy on a paperback
rack (as opposed. to an artificial text that some university professor
has chosen and possibly tampered with). We used four texts. One was an
unsigned ""Talk of the Town"" essay from The New Yorker (McPhee, 1987);
in this case the interviewer handed the readers an actual July 6, 1987
issue of the magazine. Two others were recently-published short stories
by an author who taught on our campus and lived in the local town (Thompson,
1986): in this case the readers were handed a copy of Leaping Up, Sliding
Away . The fourth story was a parodic metafiction by Ursula Le Guin
(Le Guin, (1982): readers were handed a paperback copy of The Compass
Rose . Offering our participants the texts as they appeared in their original
venue was consistent with our general and long-standing commitment to using
""authentic"" texts (as opposed to textoids), and was conceived of as a way
to ""advertise"" that authenticity. We discovered that this was even more
important than we had had expected, and entailed some methodologically
interesting consequences. One of the strongest and most consistent kinds
of distinctions we found between more and less pragmatically engaged readings
is that the more engaged (or point-driven) readers tended to take aspects
of the physical context -- particularly, the nature of the actual publication
-- into account as likely to be relevant to the reading, while other readers
seemed to assume that such concerns were unlikely to be relevant. They
tended, that is, not to use the cues provided by the venue when thinking
about matters such as the author, the date, the occasion, or the genre
of the piece. Had our study presented these texts as uniform, unidentified,
homogenized and disconnected examples of text -- pamphlets printed by computer,
for example, of the kind we have used in other research -- it is clear
that what turned out to be one of the most important differences between
these kinds of readings could not have been observed. This has, we believe, profound methodological implications for the study
of reading -- and not just for the study of ""literary"" or ""aesthetic"" reading.
If, in constructing the reading occasion, the experimenters inadvertently
block out of possibility important kinds of activities, they shouldn't
be surprised that all their readers seem to do the same things. As Anne
Freadman (1987) has pointed out in another context, a ""pretend"" tennis
match does not afford the employment of strategies and activities that
a real one does. In general, we tried to create a situation which afforded (but did not
-could not, of course -- compel) point-driven reading. The readers were
chosen to be a range, some of whom presumably were used to reading in such
a way; the situation was, as far as possible, one which did not powerfully
afford information-driven reading; and the texts were ones which it seemed
to us afforded a range of readings -- we expected, on the basis of our
own readings of the texts, that the two short stories would afford both
story- and point-driven reading more than information-driven; that the New
Yorker essay would afford point- and information-driven reading more
than story-driven; and that the Le Guin parody would strongly afford point-driven
reading. The transcribed interviews are still undergoing scrutiny. We have already
found some interesting patterns among them, which I will not describe here
in detail; we have done so elsewhere (Vipond, Hunt, Jewett & Reither,
in press). Here I wish to stress what seem to me some patterns which suggest
a good deal about the social nature of point-driven reading that our previous,
more experimentally manipulative and statistical, methods had not allowed
us to see. As I have said, our primary purpose in this study was to unpack
the some of the general notions we've outlined in previous work, and move
toward new and increasingly specific hypotheses to drive further exploration.
Let me describe three of the ideas which seem to me most important, exploring
one in particular at a little more length. I think the data show that there are indeed some regularities among
read- ers who are engaged with texts, who see themselves as having had
satisfactory experiences (not that they necessarily liked or admired the
text, but that they seem to have been engaged with it); habitual readers
who describe themselves as satisfied with their own reading and whom we
would describe (in this situation, with this text) as reading for point.
Some of these regularities were surprising, others were not. For instance, it was a surprise to me (not that I had expected something
different; rather it hadn't occurred to me to make a prediction in this
area, to ask the question at all) that such readers (as I have already
suggested) tended also to be those who see the immediate situational and
contextual frame as relevant, as something that mattered, that they talked
in terms of voluntarily. They tended to have responded to the generic cues
of the physical presentation of the text, to have not iced, for instance,
that the two stories appeared in the same book and were by the same author;
to have noticed that the essay appeared in a a certain magazine; that the
Le Guin piece was not framed as scientific exposition, but rather as fiction.
Readers who were less engaged did not; many of our readers, for instance,
persisted in reading the Le Guin as a (largely incomprehensible) physics
article, and when one, at the end of the interview, was told that it was
fiction, she expressed amazement and decided that she no longer liked the
piece because it wasn't true that, as the article proposed, the reason
we're all so short of time is that time is leaking out of a tiny hole in
the universe. It was less of a surprise to us, because we had seen evidence of this
in our previous work, that readers who were engaged seemed to act as though
the author's intentions were an important issue: for instance, they regularly
referred to authorial intention as a way of explaining the difference between
two alternative passages. I do not, incidentally, mean to suggest with
Hirsch (1967) and others that a historically reconstructed ""authorial intention""
should be the ultimate arbiter of ""the text's meaning."" Our readers were
constructing authorial intentions, often quite different from what other
readers, or we ourselves, might have constructed. As Beaugrande has observed,
""like authorship, authorial intention readily becomes our own construct
to account for our responses and values. (1987:67). This is important, I think, because it suggests that in order to treat
generic conventions and evaluations (often signaled, as Labov (1972) has
phrased it, as ""departures from the local norm of the text"") as intentional,
and to expect explanations and coherence rather than to dismiss them as
inexplicable anomalies, readers must treat text as intentionally coherent,
and thus must at least tacitly imagine an author or authority ""behind""
it, warranting that intentional coherence. All of these considerations came together in a nice contrast between
two of our participants' comments about the authorship of the two Thompson
stories. Thompson, author of ""Metaphors"" and ""The Sun on Mount Royal,""
teaches at the University of New Brunswick, located on the same campus
as St. Thomas University. Therefore some of our readers not only knew of
Thompson, but had actually met him and heard him talk about his new ""postcard
stories."" Only some of these readers, however, considered this knowledge
to be relevant when reading and discussing the stories. Don, for one, clearly
did: Jim: The question will be, what did you make of ""The Sun on
Mount Royal""? Don: This must be one of Kent Thompson's postcard stories. I talked
to him about this. Jim: Is that right? Don: Yeah, last year, I was at a party at his house and we got talking
about this and so I kind of know what he's trying to accomplish with these
about giving everything and forcing yourself to do it, you know, on the
size of a postcard. He suggested I try it and I haven't got around to trying
it. This is the first one of his I've read actually. On the other hand, Kevin, who has also (it turned out) had advance notice
of postcard stories, keeps this knowledge separate from his reading, as
can bee seen in the ""wrapup"" discussion. Jim: Would you happen to remember the name of the individual
who wrote ""Metaphors""? Kevin: ""Metaphors,"" no . . . Jim: How about ""The Sun on Mount Royal""? Kevin: Again, no -- I can't
picture the name. Jim: All right, do you think that those two pieces may have been written
by the same individual or do you think they were written by two different
people? Kevin: ( . . . ) I think they could have been written by the same person. Jim: All right, they were written by the same person, his name's Kent
Thompson -- Kevin: Yeah, I like Kent Thompson. Jim: Are you familiar with Kent Thompson? Kevin: Yeah, I took a course from Dr. Jones two years ago on Maritime
literature and we studied some of Kent Thompson's work and Dr. Jones has
a, as you probably know, a lecture series throughout the year for that
course and he was one of the persons who came in and read for us. I know
he teaches at UNB himself. Yeah, I like his work . . . . Jim: ... There are some pieces in there that are only five or six lines
long and. . . Kevin: He started this thing a few years ago about writing on postcards,
is that inhere, too? . . . He was talking about that when he read for us. What seems to me particularly remarkable about this contrast is the way
in which Kevin, who clearly ""possessed"" the same information, simply did
not treat it as relevant to this text in this situation. It is important
to insist, incidentally, that it is not simply a matter of what knowledge
the reader has; it's a question of what knowledge is activated. If it were
simply a matter of knowledge possession, as much research -- e.g. Holmes
& Roser, 1987 -- assumes, one might say, following E. D. Hirsch (1987),
that the real difference is not one of stance or attitude, but merely a
matter of ""cultural literacy."" People we identify as reading in a point-driven
or engaged way, that is, have simply experienced more, and thus know more,
than those who are not reading in such a way (for instance, they are familiar
with the conventions of literary magazines or with authors). Kevin's failure
to use his knowledge about Kent Thompson is significant here, because it
suggests that the critical difference between these two modes of reading
is not knowledge per se, but rather the use of that knowledge -- the expectation
and assumption that such knowledge may be relevant, that one participates
actively in reading transactions (Johnston & Winograd, 1985). Both
Don and Kevin knew in advance about postcard stories, but only one of them
treated this knowledge as relevant. Finally -- we have of course found other regularities, but these are
the ones I think may be most interesting here -- readers who are reading
in this way expect that the text will have pragmatic consequences, they
expect it to be connected to their life in some way. I don't mean, though
this can also happen, that the story means something that will change one's
life. Rather, what I'm referring to is signaled by remarks like, ""I know
someone who'd like that story: can I get a copy of it?"" or, ""Who wrote
that again? I want to write that down because I want to give that book
to a friend."" That taking of the story and ""retailing"" it seemed very important
to me, because of course that's what we do with stories in conversation.
If a story strikes you as pointed and interesting and powerful and memorable,
you will often, in another situation, remember it and retell it. (""Oh,
I heard about a guy who . . . "") That seems to me analogous to what many
of our point-driven readers were doing, or expecting to do. And that was
a surprise -- not, again, because we'd expected otherwise, but because
we'd had no expectations in the area at all. This, it seemed to us, was
the sort of benefit Rubin had predicted when experimenters swap control
for regularity. The way we formulated all this for ourselves was to say that the readers
who were, in our terms, successful with these texts in this situation seemed
be doing something that looked very much as though they were engaged in
dialogue with the text (or, better, with an imputed or imagined intentional
author by means of the text). I should make it clear, by the way, that
we're not asserting that something ""is true"" about these readers as people:
we are saying only that on this occasion, reading this text, these readers
seemed to be acting in this way. I see no reason not to expect that everyone
is capable of reading in a point-driven way; after all, we are all point-driven
listeners. That at least some readers read in such a ""dialogic"" way -- and that
many did not -- seems to me worth knowing in part because it has important
consequences for literary theory and psychology, but primarily for educational
and developmental reasons. To a literary theorist it insists, for instance, that we need to include
the pragmatic dimension in our concept of the reading of imaginative texts,
of ""literature,"" which people do for their own purposes. If we are to understand
what reading is at all, we must see it as a process in which, at least
potentially, this kind of social interchange and activity is entailed.
This view is one which, as I have admitted, challenges many of my basic
assumptions about appropriate approaches in literary theory; it suggests
that although most of the ""aesthetic"" and ""interpretational"" things which
I as a hermeneutic practitioner have done may be interesting, they don't
have a lot to do with how and why people read texts -- including the ""classics""
of literature that I was interpreting and evaluating. To a psychologist it insists we need to introduce the pragmatic dimension
into our understanding of any reading. This would challenge some basic
assumptions in the psychological study of reading -- the assumption, for
instance, that reading is pretty much the same thing from one reader to
the next, from one text to the next and from one situation to the next;
the assumption that it's not a social phenomenon, but a cognitive one.
In my view, it now seems far more useful to consider reading as only in
relatively trivial ways a cognitive phenomenon: the most important things
about it can be understood, I now think, only by viewing it as primarily
a social phenomenon. But finally, and of most immediate importance here,
this new emphasis on the rhetorical and the pragmatic has powerful implications
for education and teaching. Consider, for example, the status of written
language in schools: what often happens is that the printed texts which
are used in schools -- and, as well, the written texts which are produced
in schools by students -- are consciously and deliberately designed not
to afford this kind of reading, consciously and deliberately designed to
be ""fact dumps,"" to be collections of propositions stored in an orderly
way -- not to be pointed, not to be contact-driven, not to be human. They
are written in many cases by committees, and often by corporations (Goodman,
Shannon, Freeman, & Murphy, 1988; Luke, 1988). If you look at reading
texts for young children, if you look at school textbooks in the sciences
and humanities, if you look at the introductions and the footnotes and
the explanatory material for the texts and anthologies which are usually
used in North American universities as the basis of literature courses,
you find that everything about them is written as though to make it very
difficult to read them in a point-driven way. Not impossible, of course
-- but possible only for those with a strong predisposition to read them
for human contact, and possible only in situations which afford such reading.
Schools, in general, do not provide such situations. If all that is true, and it seems to me no exaggeration, then we are
offered a plausible explanation of why it is that we get so much information-driven
reading in school situations, and so very little point- driven reading.
Perhaps it offers us a partial explanation, too, of why some people develop
into powerful manipulators of written language -- both as writers and readers
-- and why others do not. Here is a hypothesis about that question. As I have already noted, in dealing with oral language in comfortable
social situations, everyone has learned to be a point-driven listener.
Why should written language develop so differently? The usual argument works like this. It seems undeniable that oral language
is learned with a minimum of direct instruction. Children learn the basic
strategies and grammar of their native tongue within the first few years
of life. Although those ""basic"" strategies and grammar are unimaginably
complex, virtually no direct explanation of them is ever offered the child.
Indeed, it is usually the case that the adults the child has contact with
would be unable to explain even the most basic of them; and it's arguable
that no one understands all of them with anything like the thoroughness
it would require to explain them all to anyone, much less an infant. How
language is learned seems to be a matter going well beyond our power of
description -- or perhaps even understanding -- but it is clearly connected
with the child's practice of using language to make and maintain contact
with the people around her, to achieve ends which are important -- indeed,
crucial -- to the child's life and growth. If we accept Vygotsky's model
of the role of oral language in the development of human intelligence,
indeed, we would argue that the learning of oral language is the means
by which the individual, defined as a social being, creates herself --
or, as Kenneth Kaye (1982) has shown, opens and operates the dialogic relationships
that help the society around her create her. And all this language is learned
through use. Written language, however, is argued to be quite different. For instance,
it is not dialogic in the immediate way that oral language is: the employer
of written language doesn't have an interlocutor physically present to
supply the sorts of cues language learners need, and language without an
interlocutor needs, as Vygotsky himself pointed out, to be consciously
shaped to provide the information -- about what syntactic structures and
signals of coherence and so forth need to be utilized. This is, it is argued,
a very complex business and one which renders written language a form which
cannot be read in the helter-skelter, hit-or-miss fashion with which young
children regularly perform the miracle of language development. Because written language is so lacking in the support offered learners
of oral language, then, it is argued, we must supply this lack with direct
instruction. Learners need, for example, to be able to think about language
as a structure, quite separate from action (Cook-Gumperz, 1977). A young
child will learn, for instance, the oral structure of the relative clause
by engaging in a situation where the form is necessary, using it in imperfect
ways and having interlocutors be confused or hesitant, hearing it used
effectively in context where it's meaningful and related to the child's
concerns and goals, etc. In writing, however, there is no interlocutor
to be confused or hesitant, and no one to use the construction back, in
effective ways, about something with which the language learner is genuinely
concerned. So we must discursively explain the relative clause -- or the
nominative absolute, or the structure of narrative and expository genres,
or the shape of the five-paragraph theme, or the rule about where the apostrophe
goes in"" it's"", ""its ""' and ""its"" -- or the ""meaning"" of a literary text. It seems to me, however, that this argument is based on an erroneous
assumption -- that written language must by its very nature be entirely
decontextualized. This assumption depends upon accepting the view that
all writing is a lot like published print -- created in one context and
consumed in quite another, with no hint to the consumer of the context
of the creator. Not only that, it is assumed that the consumer is somehow
removed from any social context -- not only that the consumer doesn't share
a context with the producer, but also that the consumer is totally alone
as a language user: not a member of a language or discourse community,
and not a participant in an immediate, social situation. Now this may in
fact be true of some situations where written language is used, but it
is not necessarily true -- and there is no reason to think that, even if
it were widely the case, it is a situation which is either unavoidable
or desirable. If it were true that written language were habitually encountered
in such a way, then it might be true that we could not rely on the support
of social context to facilitate language learning, and we might feel it
was necessary to resort to explicit explanation (if, of course, we were
sure we understood enough of the structures to construct lucid and useful
explanat ions). If not, however, it seems clear that it would be preferable
to allow the kinds of processes which are so powerful in children's learning
of their first, oral language -- or, indeed, the kinds of processes which
writers like Stephen Krashen (1981) argue are indispensable in the learning
of second languages -- to operate. Why, then, do some children develop into readers who can readily shift
into ""point-driven"" mode and others not? It is, I think, at least plausible
that those readers who learn about written language are often those who
encounter it in situations where the sort of support available for oral
language is also available. They are those for whom parental and caregiver
story reading has helped bridge the gap between written and oral, where
written language has been regularly used by those in the child's environment,
with the child, in some of the many ways in which writing actually does
function in social contexts -- notes, lists, apologies, invitations, instructions,
etc. (Baghban, 1984; Bissex, 1980). If a child's written language develops
in the same contextualized ways as her oral language, the child will, it
seems likely, be prepared to synthesize or create contexts for written
texts, even when the actual situations and texts afford such creation only
with difficulty. The child, in other words, may be prepared to read in
point-driven as well as information- driven and story-driven ways. Finally, all this may suggest some ways in which the educational situation
can be changed. It suggests, for instance, using authentic texts, texts
which were not written to impart information to someone but which were
written to make contact, to invite mutual participation in the creation
of truth. Such texts may not necessarily or primarily be published, public
texts, but texts produced in the classroom context itself, for the immediate
social and educational purposes of the learners. It suggests a principled
rationale, that is, for the educational strategies often called ""Whole
Language"" (Harste, Woodward & Burke 1984; Newman, 1985). It suggests, further, that the best way to teach a field that has a
defined knowledge base may not be to present students with texts incorporating
in an efficiently organized way ""the truth"" about the field (for instance,
in ""the"" course psychology text or ""the"" course physics text, or even in
""the"" truth as presented in the instructor's lectures about eighteenth
century literature), but rather to find a way to give the creative initiative
to the students, help students participate in the social construction of
the knowledge of the field, to invent for themselves a role in the social
dialogue -- written and spoken -- which constitutes a discipline (Hunt,
1987a, 1987b, 1989; Hunt, Parkhill, Reither & Vipond, 1988; Parkhill,

  Susan Reid Office: BMH 401 Office Hours:Mon. 10-12 or by appointment Tel: 452-0456 reid@stu.ca   Calendar Description: The focus of this senior level seminar will be a critical analysis of the interplay 
  between government initiated programming and social policy for children and 
  youth and the ideological foundations upon which they are based. For any given 
  semester, the content of the course will reflect current controversies as well 
  as faculty and student interests. Topics may include social control theory and 
  juvenile justice; an assessment of theories of rehabilitation; the legal philosophy 
  of the young offenders legislation and its impact on juvenile justice; and an 
  evaluation of zero tolerance policies, anti-bullying campaigns, curfews, school 
  codes of conduct, and other policies which lead to more state intervention into 
  the lives of young people.  Prerequisites: CRIM 2223,

  youth social policy from a critical perspective. The effectiveness of government-initiated 
  intervention programs (and the underlying assumptions upon which they are premised) 
  will be evaluated, including programs coming out of zero tolerance, restorative 
  justice and other more crime control driven models. Further analysis will include 
  the public discourse related to the moral panic of misbehaviour on the part 
  of children and youth as reflected in popular books, articles, and media reports. 
  Students will select an area of study related to youth policy that is of interest 
  to them and conduct an applied research analysis of the issue. A particular 
  area of interest for the group this term will be youth homelessness and students 
  will be involved in preparing a fact sheet and interviewing key social service 
  agencies with respect to this issue. Participation in a student leadership conference 
  to be held on campus September 21 will form the culmination of the work completed 
  by the class with respect to this issue.   Course Format: The course will primarily follow an advanced seminar format. Teaching methods 
  are designed to maximize student participation and will include class discussion 
  of assigned readings and seminar presentations by students. Students are expected 
  to attend all classes and to be prepared to discuss the issues raised in the 
  assigned readings as well as provide informed, constructive feedback to their 
  peers on their individual seminar projects.  Student Seminar 
  Presentations begin the week after Thanksgiving!  Seminar Presentation: 
  25% 5% visual aids/ student handouts, 5% student involvement,5% critical analysis, 
  10% content Students will be responsible for presenting the topic of their research paper 
  to the seminar class for feedback and discussion prior to submitting the final 
  research paper. The class will be provided with the draft 1 of the paper by 
  e-mail, 3 days before the date scheduled for the seminar presentation. Students 
  who are in attendance at the seminar are required to provide substantive feedback 
  and generate additional questions of the student presentation topic based on 
  readings and other materials in the course.   Research Paper: 40% (outline/draft 1 = 15%, final 25%) Students will complete a ten to fifteen page research paper on some aspect of 
  child and youth policy that is consonant with the course topics. This paper 
  will show evidence of a clear analysis of the scholarly literature, applicable 
  laws and policy documents, and critical analysis of the data collected. The 
  first draft of the paper will be circulated to the seminar class 3 days prior 
  to the seminar presentation. Students in the class are responsible for providing 
  feedback and suggestions on the draft. Integration of the key areas raised by 
  students during the seminar presentation will be required for the final paper   Seminar Feedback to students on draft paper 10%  Field Interviews,

Considered as the ""eulogist of Acadia"", Antonine Maillet has undoubtedly immortalized Acadia for all her Canadian and world-wide readers.? By daring to write in colloquial Acadian French, she became the first Canadian author to record the rich oral traditions of her people in order to preserve their culture and their identity.   Jo-Ann Garnier Lafontant ? Founder, ?enpaK? Jo-Ann became involved at a very young age in humanitarian activities and continues to be often in touch with children living in special circumstances.? As a youth activist she was a founding member of the Toussaint King Center for Non Violence and social changes in Haiti and obtained her degree in Law.? Her active involvement in non profits led her to volunteer in social activities in: detention centres for women and minors, underprivileged school campus, Mayan communities in Yucatan, Mexico and other neglected communities in Haiti. In 1996, she became a member of the organization ? Women in democracy, Vital Voices ? which promotes women's participation and gender equity in all sectors of national life, particularly in decision making positions.? After having worked for 3 years in the financial sector, she joined Plan in Haiti in September 2003 as the national child right technical advisor, in October 2007 became Participation Technical Advisor, in 2008 the Program Manager and after the earthquake became the interim Country Director for Plan in Haiti before being the Director of Policy, Strategy and Advocacy for Plan in Haiti.? In October 2011, she launched with other colleagues a local organisation ?enpaK? the Creole word for ?impact? which focuses on local capacity building. ?enpaK? is a non for profit right based organisation. Jo-Ann is married and a mother of two.

The diploma program is also offered to students who have completed a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science at Memorial University or at another recognized university. The diploma in GISciences consists of a series of courses in cartography, geographical information systems, and remote sensing. Two instructional field placement courses provide the students with opportunities to use their skills and to apply their knowledge to industry-related problems. Throughout the program, students will learn to compile geo-referenced databases, design and produce maps, analyze data in geographic information system environments, produce digital elevation models, and extract information from aerial photographs and satellite images. Students who complete the diploma will understand and appreciate how cartography, geographic information systems and remote sensing are integrated with one another. The diploma in GISciences is of interest to people in many fields; it is a valuable complement to undergraduate studies in social and natural sciences programs such as anthropology, biology, computer sciences, earth sciences, economics, engineering, environmental sciences, geography, health and medicine, history, physical oceanography, political sciences, resource management, and the study of languages. Cartography, geographic information systems, and remote sensing provide effective methods of gathering, managing, analyzing and representing geographic information. Cartography involves the compilation, organization, and visual representation of spatial information in a presentational form (i.e. map) that efficiently communicates geographic relationships. Geographic information systems enable the compilation, organization, and processing of spatial (i.e., maps) as well as non-spatial (i.e., text, statistics, and graphs) data. Socio-economic, political and environmental management decision-making is supported by the results of geographic information system analyses and modeling. Remote sensing images, recorded from aircrafts and satellites, provide resourceful information to observe and study the cultural and physical landscapes. Examples of remote sensing applications include land cover mapping, environmental quality evaluation, and natural resources exploration, assessment and monitoring.

When circumstances warrant, this requirement may be waived on the recommendation of the Head of the Department. Applicants should also refer to the Qualifications for Admission given under the Regulations Governing the Degree of Master of Science within the School of Graduate Studies section of the current Calendar. International applicants are strongly encouraged to submit results of the (general) Graduate Record Examination (GRE) test.   24.10.2 Programs    24.10.2.1 Option 1 - Thesis Route     Candidates are required to complete a minimum of 15 credit hours in graduate program courses, 9 of which must be in Computer Science (excluding COMP 601W and COMP 6999).    Full-time students are expected to complete their course work within their first year of studies. Part-time students are expected to complete their course work by the end of the seventh semester in their program.    Candidates must participate in the Research Forum at least once during their program. The Student Research Forum is organized by the Department of Computer Science and takes place in the Winter term of each academic year.    Each candidate is required to submit an acceptable thesis. The thesis project may involve a theoretical investigation and/or the development of an original, practical system. Each candidate is required to present a tentative outline of his/her proposed research to the Supervisor, with a copy to the Department Committee on Graduate Studies, by the end of his/her third semester in the program (sixth semester for part-time students). A fifteen minute oral presentation of the proposal is to be scheduled and given within four weeks of the submission date.    Prior to submission of a thesis, normally in the last semester of the program, candidates are required to present a seminar on the thesis topic, methods employed, and research results.     24.10.2.2 Option 2 - Course/Project Route with Work Term     Candidates are required to complete a minimum of 24 credit hours in graduate program courses, of which at least 18 credit hours must be in Computer Science.    Within this credit requirement, a student must take the following courses:   COMP 6999 (Master?s Project)  One course in Software Engineering (COMP 6905)  One course in Algorithms (COMP 6901 or COMP 6902)     Additionally students are required to complete one co-operative education work term (COMP 601W). The work term is a full-time, paid work experience with one employer and either a four or eight months in duration. The work term should start in the third semester of the program. The work term can be deferred to the fourth semester, but normally only in the event of an unsuccessful job search for the third semester.    The dates for starting and finishing each work term are shown in the University Diary .    Students must successfully complete at least 12 credit hours (four courses) prior to beginning their work term. Students must have at least one required course remaining after their work term.    Students will conduct job searches with an Academic Staff Member in Co-operative Education in cooperation with the Department of Computer Science. It is the student?s responsibility to seek and obtain a work term placement and to communicate with all parties both within the University and beyond in a professional manner. Work term placements cannot be guaranteed by the Department of Computer Science or an Academic Staff Member in Co-operative Education, although every effort will be made to assist students in their job search. Work term placements obtained outside the job competition must be confirmed by letter from the employer and approved by the Head of Computer Science and by an Academic Staff Member in Co-operative Education on or before the first day of the work term. Work term placements may be outside Newfoundland and Labrador.    Each work term placement will be supervised by the candidate?s program Supervisor, the on-site Supervisor assigned by the employer and the Academic Staff Member in Co-operative Education. The overall evaluation of the work term is the responsibility of the program Supervisor, on-site Supervisor and the Academic Staff Member in Co-operative Education. The work term shall consist of two components:    On-the-job Student Performance as evaluated by the on-site Supervisor and the Academic Staff Member in Co-operative Education, in consultation with the program Supervisor.    A Work Report graded by the program Supervisor in consultation with the on-site Supervisor.      Evaluation of the work term will result in the assignment of one of the following final grades:    Pass with Distinction: indicates outstanding performance in both the work report and work performance.    Pass: Indicates that PERFORMANCE MEETS EXPECTATIONS in both the work report and work performance.    Fail: Indicates FAILING PERFORMANCE in the work report and/or the work performance. If a failing grade is assigned, the student?s Masters program will be terminated.      Prior to graduation and after successfully completing COMP 6999 (Master?s Project), candidates are required to present a seminar on their projects.     24.10.3 Other Regulations     Students from either Option 1 - Thesis Route or Option 2 - Course/Project Route with Work Term may request to transfer between both options once during their studies, after at least two semesters in the program.    All candidates are expected to take an active part in seminars and other aspects of the academic life of the Department of Computer Science.    Full-time students are expected to complete all program requirements in two years. Part-time students are expected to complete all program requirements in four years.     24.10.4 Courses   A selection of the following graduate courses will be offered to meet the requirements of candidates, as far as the resources of the Department will allow. Normally, students will be expected to complete their course work during the fall and winter semesters. Courses might not be offered in the spring semester.   601W Work Term  6758-6769 Special Topics in Computer Applications  6770-6790 Special Topics in Computer Science  690A/B Research Methods in Computer Science  6901 Applied Algorithms (credit may be obtained for only one of 6901 and 6783)   6902 Computational Complexity (credit may be obtained for only one of 6902 and 6743)   6903 Concurrent Computing  6904 Advanced Computer Architecture (credit may be obtained for only one of 6904 and 6722)   6905 Software Engineering (credit may only be obtained for one of 6905 or 6713)   6906 Numerical Methods (credit may only be obtained for one of 6906 or 6731)   6907 Data Mining Techniques and Methodologies (credit may be obtained for only one of 6907 and 6762)   6908 Database Technology and Applications (credit may be obtained for only one of 6908 and 6751)   6909 Fundamentals of Computer Graphics (credit may be obtained for only one of 6909 or 6752)   6910 Services Computing, Semantic Web and Cloud Computing  6911 Bio-inspired Computing  6912 Autonomous Robotics (credit may be obtained for only one of 6912 and 6778)   6913 Bioinformatics  6914 3D Modelling and Rendering  6915 Machine Learning  6916 Security and Privacy  6918 Digital Image Processing (credit may be obtained for only one of 6918 or 6756)   6921 Syntax and Semantics of Programming Languages (credit may be obtained for only one of 6921 or 6711)   6922 Compiling Methods (credit may be obtained for only one of 6922 and 6712)   6924 Formal Grammars, Automata and Languages  6925 Advanced Operating Systems  6926 Performance Evaluation of Computer Systems (credit may be obtained for only one of 6726 and 6926)   6928 Knowledge-Based Systems (credit may be obtained for only one of 6928 or 6755)   6929 Advanced Computational Geometry (credit may be obtained for only one of 6929 or 6745)   6930 Theory of Databases (credit may be obtained for only one of 6930 or 6742)   6931 Matrix Computations and Applications (credit may only be obtained for one of 6931, 6732, and CMSC 6910) (cross-listed with CMSC 6910)   6933 Nonlinear and Linear Optimization (cross-listed with Mathematics 6202)   6932 Matrix Computations in Control (credit may only be obtained for one of 6932 or 6738)   6999 Master?s Project   Click Course Number for Information  No course Data.

PhD Students     Cate Little, B.Comm., B.Sc., M.Sc.  (Ph.D Candidate) Spotted wing Drosophila ( Drosophila suzukii ) is an invasive pest of soft-skinned and stone fruits in North and South America and Europe. I am investigating the evolution of olfaction and reproductive behaviour that allow spotted wing Drosophila to compete effectively with native Drosophila species. I will use electrophysiological and behavioural assays to identify chemical cues used by spotted wing Drosophila for mate attraction and host selection. I will follow up with field testing to capitalize on these evolved olfactory and behavioural traits to improve lure efficacy and specificity for early detection and monitoring programs.  [Back To Top]    Masters Students      Christopher Burgart  (M. Sc. Cadidate) completed his undergraduate degree at Dalhousie University. His research is focused on cultivar preference in European apple sawflies and apple maggots and is being carried out at Acadia Univerisity and the Agri-Food and Horticultural Research Center in Kentville.       Jesse Saroli  (M.Sc. Candidate) I?m currently working on developing a pheromone based control method for the blueberry flea beetle ( Altica Sylvia ), which is an important pest of the Maritime lowbush blueberry crop. I hope to be able to chemically identify any active pheromones used by Altica sylvia for possible future use in traps as a monitoring and control method. I?m working towards this goal by completing field and lab bioassays and pheromone composition identification in the lab with the help of Gas-Chromatography Mass-Spectrometry.    Rebecca Rizzato  (M.Sc Candidate) The goal of my research is to examine the evolution and divergence of olfaction in heliothine moths. Heliothine moths are notorious crop pests in North America and around the world, feeding on a variety of plants such as corn, cotton, and tobacco. My research involves using a comparative approach combining behavioural, genetic, anatomical, and physiological techniques to examine the mechanisms in which pheromone production and detection may have evolved and diverged within the heliothine group. The findings of my research could potentially contribute to a global initiative to find new strategies for pest monitoring and management.    Heather Crozier  (M. Sc. Candidate) I am from Bible Hill, Nova Scotia, and have attended St. Francis Xavier University where I obtained a B.Sc in Biology, then I attended the former Nova Scotia Agricultural College, and graduated from Dalhousie University Faculty of Agriculture  with a B.Sc Agr. in Environmental Science, where I published my undergrad research on the Susceptibility of Chrysochus auratus , a natural enemy of spreading dogbane, to insecticides used in wild blueberry production.  My research is on the effects of odorants from cultivars of highbush blueberry on Drosophila suzukii (Diptera: Drosophilidea), which is a relatively new insect pest to this region.   Loay Jabre  (M. Sc. Candidate) Loay Jabre is a Masters student investigating the interaction between the cabbage maggot, Delia radicum , and its host plants. He is using electroantennogram technology and bioassays to understand the relationship between the fly and its host plant volatiles as well as field studies to examine possible eco-friendly monitoring traps for this pest.        Rylee Isitt  (M. Sc. Candidate) I did my B.Sc. in biology at the University of Northern British Columbia (UNBC), and am currently a master's student at UNBC co-supervised by Dr. Dezene Huber and Dr. Kathy Bleiker. I am studying the geographical variation in pheromone blends between eastern and western populations of the spruce beetle ( Dendroctonus rufipennis ). Spruce beetles use pheromones to attract mates and for coordinating mass attacks on host trees. Forestry professionals can take advantage of these pheromones to lure spruce beetles into traps as a way of managing beetle outbreaks. By better understanding if and how spruce beetle pheromones differ across North America, more efficient lures might be formulated. Although British Columbia is my home province, I have come to Acadia University to work with eastern populations of spruce beetle. Other interests of mine include macrophotography, electronics, software engineering, and other similarly geeky pursuits.    Simon Pawlowski  (M. Sc. Candidate) I completed my undergraduate degree in 2014 here at Acadia and am currently continuing on my Honour?s work on Orchestes fagi (Coleoptera: Curculionidae). Alongside the Canadian Forest Service, my project aims at developing effective monitoring tools for this invasive pest of beech trees in Nova Scotia. I have also done research with the Fundy Ocean Research Centre for Energy on harbour porpoises in the Minas Passage.     [Back To Top]    Honours Students    Melissa McGuire (Honours Student) I am working on my Honours this summer with Kirk and the team! My main focus includes the evaluation of the survivorship and fitness of larval progeny from non-choice mating assays and mate choice by conspecfic females in relation to hairpencil compound composition released by males. I have investigated mating behaviour of Heliothis virescens and Helicoverpa zea that are both growing concerns for agriculture success in North America. I will be starting my fourth year at Acadia University this fall and plan to be completed this project and graduating in the spring of 2015.     Rylee Oosterhuis  (Honours Student) I have completed my third year in the Bachelor of Science program at Acadia University with a double major in Biology and Chemistry. I am currently working on my Honours in Biology and concurrently completing my first co-op term in the Hillier lab. My research focuses on identifying potential attractants of Varroa destructor mites, a parasite of honeybees, based upon pheromones produced by honeybees. The goal is to identify and synthesize semiochemical analogues similar to those produced by honeybees which will attract V. destructor but not disrupt normal honeybee behaviour. These analogues could have broader applications to control mite infestations and provide an alternative to existing miticides.     Mark Hanes  (Honours) My research focus is to develop techniques to easily identify, monitor, and trap Varroa destructor mites within hives of the western honey bee ( Apis mellifera ). One major area of exploration is to develop odorant lure-based Varroa mite traps that do not fundamentally influence honey bee behaviour. Identifying volatile organic compounds (VOCs) specific to mite-infested honey bee colonies is also under investigation. Monitoring certain VOCs and their concentrations could potentially aid apiculturists in identifying mite-infested hives.     [Back To Top]    Technicians    Lara Thomas  (Laboratory Technician) I am working in the Hillier Lab this summer as a lab technician and I love it! I have previously worked in the lab as both an honours and a co-op student. My research at that time, focused on lure development for Spotted Wing Drosophila, an invasive species of fruit fly posing a threat to Canada's fruit crop industry. I performed electroantennograms, flywalk trials and field trapping studies, in attempt to develop an early monitoring system for the species.    Colin MacKay, M.Sc., Biologist  (Laboratory Technician) is a biologist with Acadia University/Canadian Forest Service (CFS) and is based in Halifax, N.S. Colin is a former Honours and Masters student in Dr. Kirk Hillier?s lab (co-supervised by Dr. Jon Sweeney, CFS) where he worked on the antennal sensilla morphology and olfactory physiology of the brown spruce longhorn beetle (BSLB), Tetropium fuscum . Specifically, he identified the likely candidate sensilla for olfactory reception on the antennae of T. fuscum and then used single sensillum recording (SSR) to test the responsiveness and sensitivity of male and female T. fuscum to a range of compounds such as fuscumol (the aggregation pheromone for T. fuscum ), host volatiles, and non-host volatiles. Colin is currently working with several different species of forest pests in N.S., but his main focus is on possible control measures of the invasive beach leaf mining weevil, Orchestes fagi .     [Back To Top]    Alumni    Alyson Carter  (Technician) I recently worked in the Hillier lab for the summer of 2014. My primary duties were basic lab maitenance, assisting others on project tasks and updating and maintaining the lab webste      Matt Nunn  (Honours) completed his honours thesis investigating ?Pheromones of the Red-Striped Fireworm?, and simultaneously completed a side project to examine leafhopper diversity in wild Nova Scotian blueberry fields.        Jillian Kelly (M.Sc) The objective of Jillian?s research project was to develop a pheromone-based monitoring system for Red Striped Fireworm, Aroga trialbamaculella (Order Lepidoptera, Family Gelechiidae) an economically important pest of wild blueberries in the Maritime Provinces. Her research involved examination of ecological factors which influence Red Striped Fireworm (RSF) populations in Nova Scotia wild blueberries; testing the behavioural attraction of RSF to pheromone components in lure-based field trapping systems and wind tunnel trials; using electroantennography to test the sensitivity of male moths to candidate pheromone components from field pheromone trapping trials; and examination of female sex pheromone composition of RSF from gland extracts using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GCMS).   Elisabeth Frost  (M.Sc, cosupervised with Dave Shutler) Elisabeth studied lethal and sublethal effects of a common pesticide (fluvalinate) on honeybees, by assessing mortality rates, learning, and memory. She also quantified levels of miticides in honeybees over time, looking for evidence of spread and/or detoxification. Fluvalinate is used to kill an invasive mite, but the side-effects of this treatment may do more harm than good. Lesser known fact: She was not stung the entire summer, earning the title of ?Bee Whisperer?.   Lise Charbonneau  (M.Sc., cosupervised with Dave Shutler) Lise examined the effects of Nosema infection on honeybees. Her work in the Hillier lab has included use of proboscis-extension reflex learning to evaluate learning and memory.       Adam Deveau  (Honours) The purpose of Adam?s research was to use ratiometric pairs of odorants, such as pheromones, to decipher mechanisms which modulate interactions between olfactory receptor neurons and projection neurons. This was conducted using single sensillum recording (SSR). This will eventually be used to determine if the interactions at the synapse are pre- or post-synaptic, and hopefully help provide a piece of a model for synaptic and basic network function.    Stephanie Powell  (Honours) Octopamine (OA), a biogenic amine, acts as neuromodulator, neurotransmitter, and neurohormone within invertebrates. In the peripheral insect nervous system, OA behaves as a neuromodulator which modifies the fat body, mobilizing and metabolizing lipids and carbohydrates. Furthermore, OA has been implicated in the development of ethanol tolerance in Drosophila. In vertebrates, OA binds to the receptors of other neurotransmitters, being closely related to noradrenaline, and has both noradrenergic and dopaminergic effects. Recently, humans have taken advantage of this fact, using OA in weight loss supplements, and it has been suggested as a potential treatment for ADHD, as a complementary medication with MAOI treatment and even for hangover relief. This is however accompanied by reports of increased blood pressure and stimulant side-effects. Stephanie used the model insect moth Heliothis virescens , to investigate the effects of OA on heart rate, mass of the fat body, and test for alcohol tolerance in moths, facilitated by OA. Data were further examined for effects on learned behaviour along with physiological/morphological shifts evident from OA administration.   Amy Larkin  (Honours, cosupervised with Nelson O'Driscoll, Earth and Environmental Sciences) The transfer of mercury from aquatic to terrestrial ecosystems occurs primarily via the consumption of predacious invertebrates by birds and fish. As intermediate predators, dragonfly and damselfly nymphs (Order Odonata) are important invertebrates in littoral zones and wetlands. The objective of Amy?s research was to identify changes in the foraging behaviour of damselfly naiads as a result of mercury bioaccumulation. A combination of field collected and lab reared damselfly naiads were used during the length of the experiment. Field-collected animals were acquired from Big Dam East and Big Dam West regions of Kejimkujik National Park, while lab-reared animals were be purchased from a supply house. A controlled subset of damselflies was be compared to a subset fed with standard reference material for mercury in fish tissue (DORM-2; low/high daily dosages of 250-1000 ppb). Exposed damselflies were sampled at the end of behavioural examination and analyzed for total mercury using thermal degradation the CARE laboratories at Acadia University. Data were examined to determine any relationship between dosage and rates of mercury bioaccumulation in the organism, neural deficits, or alterations in foraging behaviour.   Amy Buckland-Nicks  (Honours, cosupervised with Nelson O'Driscoll, Earth and Environmental Sciences) Mercury is methylated in aquatic ecosystems and bioaccumulates in organisms resulting in neurotoxic effects. Higher trophic levels of freshwater food webs are the most affected and well studied; however very little is known about invertebrates and terrestrial food chains. Odonates (dragonfly family) are predacious aquatic insects that are key food sources and vectors for mercury bioaccumulation for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. Preliminary data suggests odonate larvae may have high mercury concentrations (.14-1.92 ug g-1); however little is known about how life stages and tissue types affect mercury accumulation and transferral. Further research is necessary for better understanding the role of odonates in mercury bioaccumulation. The objective of Amy?s study was to determine whether mercury concentrations differ between the larval and adult stages, and between soft and hard tissues in adult dragonflies. A preliminary study examined the potential relationship between mercury concentrations in larval dragonflies, water, and fish of the area. Dragonfly larvae and adults were sampled from the shores and surrounding marshes of Big Dam West and Big Dam East lakes of Kejimkujik National Park in June, 2010. These lakes have extensive data available for mercury speciation in water, sediments, and fish. Larvae and adult dragonflies were collected using dip nets and sweep nets. Samples were counted and categorized by species (or genus), frozen in polyethylene tubes, and ultimately dried, homogenized, and weighed prior to analysis.   Ryosuke Ishigami  (Technician) Ryosuke worked as a lab technician through the Co-operative Employment program during Winter and summer 2010. His primary responsibilities are maintenance of lab colonies and development of atlases of multiple species of insect brains using a combination of histology, confocal microscopy and 3-D reconstructions.      Scott Schaffner  (Lead Programmer, 2008-2010)          Curtis Hughes  (content editor, 2009-2010)        Aaron Lee  (content editor, 2008 - 2009)           Samantha Sanford  (content editor, 2009)         Cassandra Fraser  (content editor, 2010)         Sam Coleman  (videographer and media, 2010)         Nan Kang  (programmer, 2010)         Kathleen Chiddenton  (Honours and Technician) Octopamine (OA) is an important chemical in invertebrates acting similarly to epinephrine and norepinephrine in vertebrates. OA has an important behavioural role in motivation, sensory sensitivity, as well as in reinforcement of learned behaviours. The purpose of my study was to determine the effects of OA on learning and memory as well as testing the importance of physiological state in relation to recall through a learning assay, the proboscis extension reflex (PER). Comparisons of learning ability with and without OA injections were made in Heliothis virescens . It was found that OA had a significant impact on PER percentage in moths both during training trials as well as during initial recall at 45 minutes. During 24 hour recall, the memory significantly decreased, however moths injected with a second dose of OA showed increased memory. This provides evidence for the importance of state dependant learning in memory recall and is a critical first step in understanding further the effects of OA. Kathleen was also employed as a P/T technician for animal care within the lab, and conducted a research topics investigation of changes in brain neuroanatomy during olfactory enrichment or deprivation with synapsin-staining.   Sarah Rose  (Honours)  Helicoverpa zea (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), commonly known as Corn Earworm, is a major crop pest, affecting agriculture worldwide. Males have odour-secreting hairpencil glands found at the tip of their abdomen which are extruded during courtship. Previous studies have shown that hairpencil odours may make copulation attempts by males more likely to be accepted. My study was designed to determine the effects of the H. zea male hairpencil odour on the courtship behaviour of female H. zea . Normal mating assays were conducted to first determine stereotypical courtship behaviour within the moth species. Subsequent manipulations were performed on the moths to determine the importance of the hairpencil odour in mating. The first experiment involved the removal of the female antennae at the scape. The virgin antennectomized females were then paired with normal virgin males for the mating assays following a recovery period. In the second experiment, virgin male moths underwent hairpencil ablation surgeries and were paired with normal virgin females for mating assays following a recovery period. Control trials were performed with moths who had undergone similar ?mock? surgeries. The final experiment involved ablated males with the addition of an extract of hairpencil odour that was reintroduced to the female during courtship attempts; hexane was used as a control. Results show that presence of male odour is important in the courtship and mating of H. zea .   Laura Ferguson  (Honours, cosupervised with Todd Smith, Biology) Laura investigated the potential effects of parasitism of mosquitoes by protozoa parasites, in particular in relation to effects upon host feeding behaviour. To facilitate this, Laura investigated feeding of Culex mosquitoes on Rana clamitans frogs while infected with variable infections of Hepatozoan parasites.  Emma McIntyre  (Honours, cosupevised with Todd Smith, Biology Emma investigated host choice in two species of mosquitoes ( Culex territans and Culex pipiens ). In particular, cues from two different ectothermic host species, frogs and snakes, were investigated to isolate olfactory, thermal or hygroscopic cues which might affect host choice.   Gillian MacMullin  Research Topics Gillian reconstructed the antennal lobe of two moth species, the armyworm and the tobacco budworm. In particular, she compared the structural organization of glomeruli, spheroidal structures in the antennal lobe which process different odour molecules.     Aaron Lee  (Research Topics) In addition to his work on the AI project, Aaron also conducted a two- term research topics investigation of changes in brain neuroanatomy during olfactory enrichment or deprivation with synapsin-staining.       Rhys Kavanagh  (Honours and Technician The purpose of this study was to determine whether octopamine increases sensitivity of female olfactory receptor neurons to conspecific female sex pheromone. Studies in this area will reveal more details on the evolution of sexual dimorphism and may be used in insecticide development. Extracellular neural recordings were made from female moths both injected and not injected with octopamine, and neural responses to odour stimulation were recorded. Results indicate that octopamine plays a significant modulatory role in female sex pheromone detection in female moths, increasing sensitivity to pheromones almost 1000X; and that male and female pheromone-detecting neurons share distinct pharmacological and physiological similarities in H. virescens despite their morphological differences at the antennal level. Rhys remained in the lab for an additional summer to continue this research as a technician.   Kathryn Landry  (Honours) The objective of this study was to analyze the responses elicited by interneurons in both the medial region and MGC in the antennal lobes of H. virescens males when stimulated with blends of various host-plant volatiles and pheromones. Extracellular sharp-glass electrode recording from within the brain of male moths suggests that such blends primarily cause inhibition in neurons within the isomorphic glomeruli, but also that blend stimulation may evoke synergistic responses. In addition, the pheromone and host-plant odours independently demonstrated inhibitory effects. This study suggests that odour processing of blends is configural and that communication within the antennal lobe is global. In addition, this project will provide a standard for the detection of elicited responses and allow future research using the equipment and techniques developed in this project.   Chris Ogbuah  (Technician) was working as a lab technician, and engaged in primary animal care and colony maintenance. Furthermore Chris also conducted an immunohistology-based investigation to localize octopamine within the insect brain.      [Back To Top]         Food for Thought:  ""What is a scientist after all?

Free Antivirus For students who?do not have any antivirus protection on their computer, there are a few free antivirus options such as Avast! Antivirus and Microsoft Security Essentials . Free Ad-Aware (Pop-up Remover) There is another big threat to home PC's, this is Adware.? It is ok to have a couple of different anti-adware programs running, they do not seem to conflict with each other. A company that offers a free anti-adware program is LavaSoft . Additional Antivirus notes Some viruses are really ""smart"".? The have the ability to hide from antivirus programs. There are a couple of extra things you can do to try and eradicate these troublesome viruses. Safe Mode - Windows has a mode called safe mode that loads the minimal amount of software that will allow Windows to run.? In this mode you can still run Ad-Aware and the Antivirus programs.? The advantage of running these programs while in Safemode is that a virus that may be able to mask its presence is usually not loaded in Safemode. This often allows the antivirus to locate and remove even these ""smart"" viruses: To get into smart mode, hit ""F8"", the key above #9 key when the PC is booting. There is a bit of timing involved, you need to hit the key just before windows starts loading, try tapping the key once per second after restarting your pc and you get a picture on your monitor.? If your timing is good, you will get a text screen and near the top is an entry that says ""safe mode"" use the up arrow to move up to that entry and hit the enter key. Once Windows finishes loading, it will say that it is in a special diagnostic mode. Run the Ad-Aware and Antivirus programs in this mode.? Once Scanning and repairs are finished, restart the pc and allow it boot normally.                          Help Desk Hours?? Contact Us ?       ? Quick Guides ? Frequently Asked Questions ?

There are many sub areas (e.g., artificial intelligence, databases, game development, cyber security, graphics, high performance computing, big data, networking, programming languages, robotics, etc.) within the broader discipline of CS, with new areas such as health informatics and the internet of things being created as the discipline evolves.      Why study Computer Science at StFX?  Here, you learn directly from professors, not teaching assistants , who are accomplished scholars -- many that hold National Sciences and Engineering Research Council grants and are very active in research. Together, they provide an education that prepares students well for the opportunities and challenges of the information age whether they wish to go directly into a career , go on to further studies at the graduate level , or go into an education program.      First Year Computer Science:  In first year, you will be introduced to Programming and Data Structures, which focuses on problem analysis, algorithm development, data representation and control structures.?A common misconception is that Computer Science is equivalent to programming. Programming is a necessary tool, but it is not the focus. Thus, after completing 100-level studies, the transformation from a programmer to a Computer Scientist begins.  In first year, you will?take Introduction to Computing?and Programming and Data Structures, focusing on problem solving , algorithm development , and data representation and preparing you for all second year courses in Computer Science. The department also offers other first year courses in Computer Science suitable for students in a broad range of disciplines.      Rewarding careers in Computer Science:  Job opportunities are virtually endless . They include work in software engineering, technology development such as robotics, computer vision and artificial intelligence and forensic research. Computer Science jobs are among the highest paid and have the highest job satisfaction . Most analysts predict that the number of people trained for jobs in the computing industry will fall far short of the employment demand. As a result of this shortfall, job prospects for graduates in Computer Science are expected to remain excellent.

Missing are Abu Baker, James Williams and Hina Shehzadi.    Eleven StFX graduate students?10 master?s students and one PhD student?are 2017 recipients of the Nova Scotia Graduate Scholarship, awarded to research graduates at Nova Scotia universities to help advance the economic and social well-being of Nova Scotians by investing in graduate thesis-based research in several priority sectors.  The awards encourage exploration, discovery and innovation.  At StFX, the students are involved in research projects that range from exploring educational avenues to slow out-migration in the province to the impacts of rockweed harvest.  Recipients include master?s students Andrew Flower, Hina Shehzadi, James Williams, Nadia Tarakki, Zihao Jiang, Bry Crabbe, Abu Baker, Meredith Karcz, Lori Paslawski, Alex Young and PhD student Greg Hadley.  All say the scholarship is invaluable.  ?Being awarded funding through the Nova Scotia Graduate Scholarship in the area of social innovation has allowed me to create a robust research plan of a truly?provincial scope,? says Greg Hadley of Antigonish, NS, who is completing his PhD (educational studies) under the supervision of education professor Dr. David Young.  His research examines the potential for entrepreneurship education in Nova Scotia public schools to serve as a mechanism to slow out-migration and enhance economic development.  TRULY TRANSFORMATIONAL  ?I am particularly interested in rural areas, as population decline and economic stagnation has threatened the stability of many, once vibrant, communities. As a former public school teacher in rural Nova Scotia, I have seen what population decline has done and am keen to explore what educational avenues might help to slow this troubling phenomenon,? he says. ?The funding will allow me to engage with stakeholders, academics and policymakers and, I predict, will open many other doors that may have remained closed by economic forces. This funding offers me a great deal of research?flexibility and has been truly transformative for my work.?  Meredith Karcz of Burlington ON, who is completing a MSc in biology under the supervision of Dr. David Garbary, says the scholarship both helps her afford to study and conduct a project she cares about.  She is looking at the impacts of rockweed ( Ascophyllum nodosum ) harvesting in Nova Scotia on the other algal species and invertebrates that inhabit the rockweed canopies on rocky shores across the province.  ?Rockweed harvesting is a growing multi-million dollar industry,? she says. ?The seaweed is used primarily in agricultural applications and fertilizers. Research has primarily taken a species focused approach up until this point, but to properly ensure that current harvest methods are sustainable, the impact on the entire community needs to be assessed.?  LIFE-CHANGING OPPORTUNITY  Hina Shehzadi of Lyari Karachi, Pakistan is completing a M.Ed. under the supervision of education professor Dr. Joanne Tompkins. She is working on qualitative research, a comparative analysis of two curricula relating to the understanding of university students regarding sexual and reproductive health rights of women in Nova Scotia and Karachi.   Hina for article.jpg     Hina Shehzadi  ?This scholarship is a life-changing opportunity for me because coming from an under-developing country, Pakistan, where as a young woman it was a major challenge for me to continue my higher education, this scholarship is not only supporting me to achieve my dream for becoming a university professor, but my community as well as I am the only woman travelling abroad for study and setting examples for other girls in my community to work hard and explore the opportunities in the world. I am so grateful to receive this Nova Scotia graduate grant.?  MSc biology student Alex Young of Berwick, NS, working with biology professor Dr. Russell Wyeth, is examining the nervous system of a snail species ( Lymnaea stagnalis ), identifying genes and cell types responsible for producing different neurotransmitters inside of its sensory organs (lips, tentacles) to get an idea of how the snail processes sensory information.  ?Once we understand the genes and cells present in its nervous system, those genes can be interfered with to block their action and give us an idea of their function.?The goal of my research is to get a better understanding of how the snails' genetics and nervous system are responsible for controlling its behaviour at the molecular level,? he says. ?Ultimately, my research can lead to large scale?sensory manipulation of snails with chemicals to prevent them from entering gardens or precious crop fields in countries where they are currently a major pest and a vector for several diseases.  ?Receiving a?Nova Scotia Graduate Scholarship supplement means that I will be able to complete my master?s solely on external funding.?One great thing about?that is it saves internal funds to dedicate towards my research, hopefully increasing the quality of my projects.?  AWARD AN HONOUR  ?The Nova Scotia Graduate Scholarship is an honour for me and it is also a confirmation of my hard work,? says Zihao Jiang, of Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, China, a first-year master?s student working with computer science professor Dr. Laurence T. Yang on research focused mainly on big data and matrix computation.  ?Receiving?the Nova Scotia Graduate Scholarship is a great?honour for me,? agrees master?s of science student Nadia Tarakki of Bangladesh, who is working with earth sciences professor Dr. Dave Risk.  ?This scholarship inspired me to create an effective tracer suite using isotopes to detect seepage and various emission sources. The results can be applied to mitigate health impacts in Nova Scotia, through use in issues such as emissions into residential basements and groundwater supplies,? she says.  She is working on soil gas?monitoring at the Carbon Capture and Storage project at Aquistore, Estevan,?Saskatchewan. This involves monitoring of soil gas concentrations of CO2, O2, N2 and CH4 and?isotopic value analysis of stable isotope, d13C of CO2 and radiocarbon isotope, D14C of CO2 in addition to soil CO2 surface flux?from pre-existing wells.?The objective of the research is to monitor the containment of her research site and develop an isotopic tracer suite that can differentiate between biogenic and thermogenic surface gas sources.  ?As a second-year recipient?of the NSGS, this funding provides the financial support that allows us researchers to be more able to focus on our academics and research without having financial burdens in the background,? says Bry Crabbe of Woodstock, NB, completing a master?s of science in chemistry under the supervision of Dr. Geniece?Hallett-Tapley and Dr. BJ MacLean.  He says through the use of niobium based perovskite semiconductor materials, they are studying the light induced reactions involving carbon-carbon coupling using this more energy efficient and more ?green? reaction process in the absence of heat and harsh organic materials.  ?Receiving the Nova Scotia Graduate Scholarship will allow me to use scientific instruments that study the chemistry of hundreds of rock samples and create thin sections to study the samples at a microscopic level. Each of these methods, supported by the NSGS, are essential to the development of a new structural geologic model and ultimately, the completion of my master?s research,? says Andrew Flower of Calgary, AB, taking a master?s in earth science (geology) under the supervision of Dr. Mike Melchin.  ?My study of graptolites and carbon isotopes will help create a model of mineral deposition that could potentially be used to help ore exploration in shale hosted mineral resources in Nova Scotia.?  The research is based on geological findings in the Selwyn Mountain range, located in the Howards Pass district, Northwest Territories.

Important Dates The earliest job start date is Monday, 17 April 2017. The latest job start date is Sunday, 16 July 2017. The latest job end date is Saturday, 26 August 2017.  Please note that Service Canada will not reimburse for the period of employment prior to the approved project start date indicated in the CSJ Application/Agreement form signed by Service Canada. Jobs funded under CSJ must be from six (6) to sixteen (16) weeks in duration. Normally, these weeks are consecutive.? Depending on demand and available funding, approval may be given for fewer weeks than requested in an application.?The student will be required to work full-time between no fewer than 30 hours per week and no more than 40 hours per week.  ESDC will pay 50% of Nova Scotia's minimum wage.?The ESDC hourly rate contribution (column h) should, therefore, be $5.35 which is 1/2 of $10.70 (NS minimum wage effective 1 April 2016; the new minimum wage rate for 2017 has not yet been announced).?Faculty/Staff are responsible for the remainder of the student's salary; this is usually paid out of your research or office accounts.  All applicants may be eligible for additional funding of up to $3,000 per student with disabilities to accommodate the student within the workplace.? However, only personal tools and adaptations that students require to accomplish tasks covered under a CSJ contribution agreement will be considered eligible.  Applications:  Below are links to all the information you will require to complete an ESDC application this year.?You should read this material carefully before completing an?Application Form. ?Do not submit your application directly to ESDC.? Please complete the CSJ Application, using the form-fillable Application Form (Part B) below; you must complete a separate application form for each position.? Please save your completed?Application?Form and e-mail it to?Pauline Forbes Moreau.?She will compile data from your completed electronic form and submit a collective institutional application.?Your individual application will not be submitted to ESDC.  This year, the Local Priorities for the Constituency of Central Nova (see below) have been revised and are now very favourable for individuals wishing to apply for subsidies of student research assistant positions. StFX applicants for such positions are strongly encouraged to apply.

Schlumberger, the leading oilfield services company in the world, is donating to StFX a state-of-the-art geology software package with a $10 million U.S. market value over the next three years. The company?s suite of software includes Petrel* E&P software platform, which geoscientists can use to combine surface and subsurface data to build sophisticated graphics and models of the geology beneath our feet.  ?The use of sophisticated software is now a critical skill for all students to have in order to compete for jobs in the geosciences,? said Matthew Schumacher, an environmental science instructor in the Department of Earth Sciences and the driving force behind StFX?s new collaboration with Schlumberger. ?It is also my hope that the addition of this software can bring new and exciting industry research opportunities to our department,? he said.  Mr. Schumacher says he approached Schlumberger about a software donation as he wanted students to have access to the latest resources and tools available, helping in both their education and in making them more competitive and prepared for future careers.  StFX researchers will now be able to compile and explain information in three and four dimensions providing new and exciting interpretations that were not available before. The goal is to have the software fully up and running for faculty and students to use as part of their studies by September.  ?I will now be able to not only locate potential reservoirs of groundwater by using this software, but estimate how much water is in them, as part of my own personal research initiatives. I also look forward to being able to provide more innovative technical research methods to environmental science students through the use of this software,? Mr. Schumacher added.  Dr. James Braid, an assistant professor in the department, plans on using the software both in the classroom and for research. ?My students get hands on experience using the latest advanced technology allowing them to work with and interpret multiple and sophisticated data sets. Faculty and senior students can use the Petrel platform in diverse research applications from groundwater modelling to 3-D interpretation of complex geologic systems.?

Ms. Paslawski is researching the formation of the ancient supercontinent Pangea, the potential geologic linkage between Nova Scotia and Spain, and how this supercontinent formation resulted in some of the world's most prolific copper, lead and zinc deposits.  The project is an extension of her supervisor, StFX earth sciences professor Dr. James Braid?s ongoing research in Spain looking at ancient mountain building processes.  ?In simple terms, my project is focused on aiming to understand the formation of the Iberian Pyrite Belt, which is a region in Spain and Portugal that hosts massive ore deposits, and its relationship to southern Nova Scotia,? says Ms. Paslawski of Beaverlodge, AB, who graduated from StFX last year with an undergraduate degree in earth science.  ?Current plate tectonic models show that these regions were spatially juxtaposed during the last supercontinent Pangea, so we want to understand the geodynamic history of these regions, with relation to one another.  ?During my time in Spain I have been examining field relationships between various volcanic, plutonic, and sedimentary rocks in order to understand how the region formed. I have also been collecting samples which will be used for age-dating (geochronology), and geochemistry, which will aid in the interpretation of the field relationships.?  Ms. Paslawski says this type of project is interesting because it is like trying to solve a puzzle when you are only given a few pieces.  ?I have to come up with a geological interpretation based on my own observations, limited quantitative data, and previously conducted research in the area. I think the nature of geologic research is that you only ever see 'part of the story,' and have to come up with a viable interpretation based on that. This makes it interesting, but also difficult.?  She will be in Spain about three months, time which includes field work, processing her samples at a university in Madrid, and some travelling.  ?The project was initially designed by my supervisor Dr. Braid in collaboration with some geologists from the Spanish Geologic Survey. However, the focus of the project has changed quite a bit since I started, based on what has interested me the most in the field. It has developed much more into my project, which is exciting,? she says.  Dr. Braid says Spain is an ideal location to study these processes because the ancient stitch between North America and Europe is preserved today where a piece of ancient North America remained attached to Spain. Plate reconstructions also show that when Pangea was amalgamated, Nova Scotia was likely adjacent to Iberia, so the geologic story recorded in Spain during the amalgamation of Pangea complements the story recorded in some rocks that make up Nova Scotia.  The data collected will contribute to a better understanding of supercontinent formation processes and the vital role they play in the development of economic ore deposits, he says.  Funding for the work comes via Dr. Braid?s NSERC Discovery Grant and the Spanish Geologic Survey.  ?Lori was one of the strongest undergraduate students I have seen during my tenure at StFX. She has an inquisitive and adventurous spirit, attributes that are vital in completing a geoscience M.Sc., especially when fieldwork is overseas,? Dr. Braid says.  ?I knew Lori would be a perfect fit for this project and was delighted when she agreed to continue her presence at StFX after her B.Sc. Her project is ambitious, involves integrating multiple datasets with on-the-ground observations, working on an international scale and should provide insight into ancient processes that were key in our planet's evolution and providing resources that we use today.?  Ms. Paslawski says joining the StFX Earth Science Department has opened many opportunities for her, ranging from work experience to travelling to the chance to further her education by completing a master?s degree. She says the atmosphere within the department encourages collaboration, teamwork, and the development of relationships between faculty and students, including invaluable mentorship from faculty members.

Through physics professor Dr. Hossain Ahmed, StFX has become part of the BABAR collaboration, a particle physics experiment at the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory at Stanford University in California. It?s an international collaboration having about 600 physicists and engineers from 75 institutions in 13 countries.  Particle physics, Dr. Ahmed says, is about trying to understand the universe at a fundamental level, which also allows researchers to develop new technology, such as the production of medical isotopes using accelerators.  The primary goal of the BABAR experiment, he and StFX Physics Department Chair Dr. Peter Marzlin say, was to study charge parity violation (CP Violation) in nature, but it also helped to deepen basic understanding of the universe, including lepton flavor violation, dark matter, and tests of new theories.  BABAR produced more than 500 journal papers, including the precise measurements of differences between matter and antimatter, which have proved the theory of Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa, resulting in the awarding of the 2008 Nobel Prize in Physics.  Due to its unique collision energies, BABAR data is still in high demand to analyze and prove new scientific theories, they say.  ?This data is very important to analyze physical theories,? Dr. Ahmed says. ?StFX students will get the benefit of that and they will be able to contribute to the physics community, both in the BABAR collaboration and beyond.?  ?The inclusion of StFX in the BABAR collaboration gives Dr. Ahmed and his students access to the data that has been gathered in the experiment,? Dr. Marzlin says. ?This will provide physics students with a unique opportunity to get involved in analyzing data of a major scientific experiment, which is only accessible to institutions that are part of the collaboration. Hence, for the first time, StFX students can get involved into experimental elementary particle physics.?  Dr. Ahmed, the first to work in particle physics at StFX, has been working with BABAR since 2009, both as a post-doctoral fellow and as a faculty member while at other institutions. He says when he came to StFX he thought about how the collaboration may work here and decided to approach the collaboration board, presenting a proposal of the benefits of including StFX as a collaborator.  Dr. Marzlin says being accepted as a collaborator is a big deal.  ?It?s not that easy to get into that big of a collaboration. It?s by no means automatic. It speaks for Dr. Ahmed?s qualities as a researcher that StFX was so quickly accepted into that collaboration,? he says.  They say they are now working on providing opportunity for StFX students to become involved, including looking at options for students to visit the SLAC lab.

Back: Stephanie MacIntyre, Michelle McPherson, Michael Reid, Amanda Vosman, Danny Pink, and Warren Laybolt. Missing is Emmaline Atherton.  Nine master?s students at StFX have earned $58,811 in funding from the 2015 Nova Scotia Research and Innovation Graduate Scholarships, awards created by the Province of Nova Scotia to help advance the economic and social wellbeing of Nova Scotians.  The scholarships are designed to invest in graduate thesis-based research in defined priority sectors of ocean/marine technology; life sciences; information and communications technology; clean technology; aerospace and defense; resource sectors; financial services; health and wellness; and social innovation.    The master?s students include Emmaline Atherton, Warren Laybolt, Stephanie MacIntyre, Michelle McPherson, Kieran Murphy, Danny Pink, Michael Reid, Pritam Saha, and Amanda Vosman.    ?I'm very excited to receive this award because it will allow me to focus more of my attention toward my research,? says Danny Pink, a master?s earth sciences student from Ramea, NL, who is aiming to measure the level of greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide, emitted from streams in agricultural areas as a byproduct of crop fertilization. He received a $3,000 scholarship and is supervised by earth sciences professor Dr. Lisa Kellman.    He?ll also be measuring multiple aspects of water quality such as oxygen content and nitrogen pollution - key factors in algal blooming and fish kills. Overall, he says this information can provide insight as to how agricultural practices and indirect greenhouse gas emissions are related, the factors that influence these relationships in stream environments, and how we might become more efficient in terms of fertilizer use in the future.    ?This scholarship benefits in two ways: by reducing the financial strain of being a grad student, and by drawing attention to the research-oriented master's programs here at X. It's a big helping hand, and much appreciated,? he says.    Master?s earth sciences student Stephanie MacIntyre of Antigonish, NS, who receives a $3,000 scholarship and is supervised by Dr. Kellman, says her research focuses on the implications of forest harvesting on soil stability, in particular how clearcutting alters the quality and quantity of carbon lost from soil profiles.    ?I'm very grateful to have received a Nova Scotia Research and Innovation Graduate Scholarship. This project is something I care about and am really interested in, and this award will allow me to develop a better understanding of soil stability in response to land use disturbances.?    MEANS A LOT    ?It really means a lot for the work I am carrying out,? says biology master?s student Kieran Murphy of Glenealy, County Wicklow, Ireland, who received a $10,000 scholarship and is supervised by biology faculty Dr. Russell Wyeth and Dr. Cory Bishop.    The main goal of his research is to be able to predict where a species of sea squirt, Ciona intestinalis , commonly referred to as the vase tunicate, will grow, and to what extent it will grow. This is with aquaculture, particularly mussel farming, in mind, he explains.    The vase tunicate is an invasive marine species in Nova Scotia and causes problems by growing all over cultured shellfish and aquaculture equipment. This issue is called biofouling. Mr. Murphy, who is linked to the Centre for Biofouling Research at StFX, says in order to help mussel farmers, he is first conducting basic monitoring of marine biological communities and the nearshore environment all over Nova Scotia. The data enables researchers to develop predictive models that could potentially assist aquaculture and invasive species management.    He says the scholarship is a great help.    ?I have been at X for over a year and a half, and I should have been finishing up in August. In order to fully replicate my work carried out in 2014, I was searching for additional funding so I could stay on for longer. The results from my work in 2014 are very promising and my supervisors Dr. Russell Wyeth and Dr. Cory Bishop agreed that ideally I would extend my program to make the most of this research project and continue fieldwork until October/November 2015.    ?I was granted an extension until May 2016, and this scholarship will allow me to really do this project justice. We are hopeful that with a full second field season this year, there will be a strong predictive model as an end result. This should directly benefit the province socially and economically, by helping small businesses in rural Nova Scotia have a more sustainable future.?    TIMELY WORK   Michelle McPherson of Dartmouth, NS, a master?s earth sciences student co-supervised by earth sciences professor Dr. Hugo Beltrami and nursing professors Dr. Patti Hansen-Ketchum and Dr. Donna Pierrynowski MacDougall received a $3,000 scholarship. She is hoping to visually demonstrate the estimates of the current distribution and future emergence of the Lyme disease vector, Ixodes scapularis , in Nova Scotia and Ontario. Ms. McPherson, Mr. Pink, Ms. MacIntyre and Mr. Laybolt are also part of StFX's CREATE training program in Climate Science.   ?This study will also validate the range of variability that exists in these estimates. Predicting the current and future occurrence of arthropod vectors and diseases is of great importance to the public health system,? she says.  ?It enables timely diagnosis and treatment and raises awareness regarding at risk regions. Secondly I will be exploring how the provincial public health departments of Nova Scotia and Ontario have been altering their Lyme disease response plan alongside changes in Lyme disease incidence rates. This could provide decision makers with information that could facilitate adaptation planning in the coming years and could ultimately reduce the burden of Lyme disease.?  The scholarship will makes a big difference, she says.    ?It is really nice to be recognized for the work that is being done here at StFX. There is so much going on here, research-wise, that most people don't realize. Being a student, it is not easy to pay expenses without having a part-time job. This award helps so much. It allows students to spend that much more time focusing on school.?    RESEARCH FOCUS  Pritam Saha, a master?s in earth sciences student from Rangpur, Bangladesh, supervised by earth sciences professor Dr. Alan Anderson, has received a $10,000 scholarship and says he is studying the oxide minerals solubility. ?This award makes me feel confident and financially gives me some comfort.?  ?It is an honour to receive this award and it will provide financial stability as I go forward with my research, allowing me to completely focus on my research project,? says master?s earth sciences student Michael Reid of Oxford, NS, who received a $10,000 scholarship and is supervised by Dr. Anderson. His research focuses on the crystallization of lithium ore minerals from lithium-rich melts and the processes involved in the growth of these minerals. The results of his research will aim to better understand the formation of pegmatites, a common host of lithium deposits.    ?I am honoured to be chosen as a recipient of this award; it is a validation of the research that I and other members of our lab are doing, which has the potential to evolve the clean energy sector in Nova Scotia and beyond,? says Warren Laybolt of Dartmouth, NS, an earth sciences master?s student supervised by earth sciences professor Dr. Dave Risk. He receives a $3,000 scholarship.    ?It is encouraging to see and receive government support for research and innovation in Nova Scotia, since it is my hope to find meaningful employment in my field, without having to leave the province, upon my graduation.?    He says his main project is aimed at evaluating the coupling between soil gas emissions, and concentrations of gases in the lower atmosphere. He?s also working on the development of atmospheric transport models, to aid in the detection and identification of leaks in coal bearing and carbon capture storage areas.    Earth sciences master?s student Amanda Vosman, supervised by Dr. Kellman, received a $6,811 scholarship, and Emmaline Atherton, a master?s earth sciences student supervised by Dr. Risk, received a $10,000 scholarship.    Ms. Atherton of Rockwood, ON will be working on a project that involves measuring fugitive gas emissions from shale gas developments in British Columbia and comparing these emissions to other oil and gas developments in Canada. The results of this project could help locate greenhouse gas leakage sources locally or industry-wide, she says. ?Ultimately, the goal of this project is to aid in reducing unnecessary greenhouse gas emissions from the fossil fuel industry in Canada while we transition to cleaner, renewable sources of energy. The results from this project could also be something for Nova Scotians to consider when making decisions about energy developments within our own province in the future,? she says.  ?I am extremely grateful to have been considered for this award, let alone receive this much financial aid for a project I am a part of. It is very encouraging to be supported so early on in my graduate studies and it motivates me to put in my best effort when completing this project. Improving the environmental aspect of the energy sector has been an interest of mine for a long time, and receiving this award confirms to me that research in this field is important.?

Yang one of 52 new Fellows inducted into the Canadian Academy of Engineering   StFX professor Dr. Laurence T. Yang one of 52 new Fellows inducted into the Canadian Academy of Engineering          Tweet       July 5th, 2017    StFX computer science professor Dr. Laurence T. Yang (right) with CAE president Dr. Douglas Ruth    StFX computer science professor Dr. Laurence T. Yang is one of 52 new Fellows inducted into the Canadian Academy of Engineering (CAE) during a ceremony held in Ottawa on June 26, 2017.  The CAE is the national institution through which Canada's most distinguished and experienced engineers provide strategic advice on matters of importance to Canada. The CAE is an independent, self-governing and non-profit organization established in 1987. Members of the CAE are nominated and elected by their peers to honorary fellowships, in view of their distinguished achievements and career-long service to the engineering profession.  The Canadian Academy of Engineering works in close cooperation with other senior academies in Canada and internationally. It is a founding member of the Council of Canadian Academies, along with the Royal Society of Canada and the Canadian Academy of Health Sciences. The CAE is also a member of the International Council of Academies of Engineering and Technological Sciences, which includes some 26 similar national bodies around the world.  ?We welcome the new Fellows, who are all engineers of outstanding abilities. While they have widely varying backgrounds, what they all have in common is the demonstrated ability to go beyond the normal practice of engineering and contribute in exemplary ways towards their fields and to their communities,? says CAE president Dr. Douglas Ruth.  ?We expect great achievements through their participation in the academy?s activities. In our past, Fellows of the academy have produced major studies in the fields of education, energy and innovation; we look forward as to how these new Fellows will explore new and exciting areas of engineering and their impact on public policy.?  Dr. Yang?s citation from the event reads:  Dr. Yang is a visionary leader in the area of parallel and distributed (cloud) computing, embedded and ubiquitous systems, and big data. His pioneering research on cyber-physical-social system design and data analytic has opened up a new research direction, inspired the work of many researchers and made significant impact on society. He is a very active and valued mentor to many students and international colleagues. He has spent tireless volunteer effort on IEEE technical committees and societies and many IEEE conferences as a steering chair. His visionary leadership on bi-lateral relations between Canada and China in post-secondary education and research has created significant collaborative opportunities for researchers and students of both countries. Finally, his 2010 book ? Mobile Intelligence ? (Wiley) received an Honorable Mention from the American Publishers Awards for Professional and Scholarly Excellence.

Posted on  March 24, 2013  by  Lauren    Share this post:  Share on Facebook  Share on Twitter  Share on StumbleUpon  Share on Reddit  Share on Tumblr       So, I wrote a blog a little earlier this year about ways to get home ? and I just wanted to give you all a quick update on that post. If you wanted to read the post about different bus routes you can take to get from Brock to wherever you call home click HERE!   Anyways, this past week both my roomate and I got an email from Megabus. I?m sure if you live in the GTA and have spent ANY time on the major highways you have seen their buses. They?re normally bright blue, and they advertise in big letters that they have trips from Toronto to Niagara for $1. So what does this have to do with Brock you ask?  Well, recently Megabus started to service St Catharines which means that you can take a bus from St Catharines to Hamilton OR to Toronto for $1.00 (plus a $0.50 service fee and tax).  I thought that this MUST be a scam, or something had to be wrong with this service? so being the dedicated blogger that I am, I looked into it this past weekend. For me to get from St Catharines to Hamilton then Hamilton to Kitchener the grand total was : $2.83. That?s right, as opposed to the bus that I normally take that is a $35.00 saving (Check out the screenshot if you don?t believe me!!) As well, Megabus is sponsored by Coach Canada, so it?s not like you have to feel unsafe getting onto a ?sketchy? bus and finally, the buses come right into the main bus terminal in St Catharines so it?s not like you need to travel to some distant location in order to find the buses.  All you need to do to take Megabus is to buy a ticket online at least the day before you  I told you it was only $2.83!!  intend to travel (they take VISA and Mastercard) then bring the reservation number that they email to you, let the driver know you registered with Megabus and the bus driver will check the number against the little slip they were given for the journey. Heck, they?ll even text you the number if that?s easier for you, or you don?t have data and can?t pull the email up on your cell phone. After that, it?s just as easy as climbing on the bus, turning on that iPod and drifting off to sleep.  If you?re going to be going back and forth from home to school look into the options that come with the Megabus reserved seating! The link to their website is here and frankly, even if the $1.00 bus times don?t work for you, the rides are cheaper anyways!  Best of luck with the last few weeks of school badgers!        About Lauren Hey guys! I'm Lauren and I'm entering my fourth (and final!!) year at Brock in Psychology. In my spare time I enjoy watching movies, testing out the coffee shops around town, taking in the sites around Niagara and hunting for steals at the local shopping hotspots. This is my second year as a Campus Experience Coordinator and I?m absolutely ecstatic to be coming back for another year!
 
I knew that I wanted to come to Brock the moment that I set foot on campus, and it?s my biggest hope that you can feel as at home as I?ve felt with this school. If you have any questions, comments or concerns please don?t hesitate to leave a comment on my blogs and I?ll be sure to get back to you with the answer!  View all posts by Lauren ?

It?s the Schmon Tower, named after ?the chair of the Brock University Founders? Committee, Arthur Schmon. The tower is 13 stories tall and contains tons of useful services which are super handy to know about. So that?s why I?m going to take the time now to outline some of the most useful services in the tower and tell you whats on each floor!  1. The first floor of the Tower is Market Hall, a place where students can grab food (there?s a dining hall) and sit and study, hang out, catch up or do whatever! There are also classrooms located on this floor in the hallway outside of market!  2. The second floor is the Matheson Learning Commons. There are a ton of services for students here including:   The circulation desk where you can sign out all of the resources avaiblable to Brock students  Printers and scanners for you to use!  The Makerspace where you can see all sorts of things in the works of being made and engineered!  Group study rooms!  Learning services drop in help. If you?re looking for a little bit of guidance with writing or studying, or math and science, this is a good place to start!   3. The third floor is home to BROCK CENTRAL the one stop shop for students to get information on Admissions, records, and transcripts, as well as all things finance and related services. This floor is also home to Student Awards and Financial Aid where students can find information on OSAP, bursaries, awards and financial records, pay tuition and inquire about anything related  4. On the fourth floor of the tower we have the Student Accessibility Services (click the link to visit the webpage) where you can find tons and tons of student services, including disAbility services, personal counselling and many other services!  5. The fifth through tenth floor of the tower is home to the Brock University Library ! Each floor has study space, books, and resources students can access and work with in order to complete assignments. The Brock collection has over 1.5 million items to help students with their assignments and research. Another cool feature about the library is its volume control. The way the sound level works is the higher you go up the quieter it gets. So on the 2nd, 5th 6th and 7th floors, there?s a lot of tables for group study and talking at a normal level is allowed. Floors 8 and 9 allow for whispering level and floor 10 is completely silent.  11. The eleventh floor has the Library Collections, Library Liaison Services and Data Research Services. It also contains offices for the auditor, ?and the Office of the University Secretariat. Not too often would students need to go to this floor  12. Internal university offices are located on this floor and aren?t accessed by students too frequently. Some of the offices include human resources and internal finance  13. This is where the president?s office is located! On this floor there is an amazing view that our senior administrators are able to enjoy as well as anyone who uses the meeting rooms on this floor. The boardroom located up here houses many meetings including the BUSAC meetings as well as BUSU meeting, ?staff meetings, ?many committee meetings, as well as a lot of other meetings.  Well there you have it badgers ? a brief outline of everything in the Schmon Tower, hopefully when you get on campus you?ll know exactly whats in the tower.  Anyways, that?s it for now future badgers.  Naomi ? out!!        About Naomi Hi there future badgers! My name is Naomi and I'm in my fourth year of the concurrent education, intermediate/senior stream with a drama major and a french minor, quite the mouthful I know - but basically it means that when I'm done here at Brock U I want to teach high school. So now you may be wondering why I chose Brock? I chose Brock because the minute I stepped on campus I felt at home. Brock had it all, the program, the community and the environment I was looking for in my post secondary school of choice. Want to hear more about my experiences?  Check out my blog posts! feel free to ask any questions and I'll be happy to respond!  View all posts by Naomi ?           Leave a Reply Cancel reply   Your email address will not be published.

It?s accessible to every individual when and if needed. Known by a variety of other names, most frequently Guaranteed Annual Income or Citizen?s Income, BIG creates a solid income floor for us all. It will both eliminate deep poverty and substantially alleviate the income insecurity afflicting ever more Canadians. In contrast to welfare programs, BIG is unconditional; most notably there are no work requirements. Nor are recipients required to liquidate all assets? (eg, homes, cars)?or to submit to various bureaucratic rules about how they live and spend their money. BIG is si mple and inexpensive to administer, respectful of the autonomy of recipients, free of the stigma and hassle of the current maze of programs and designed to avoid the work disincentives that plague them. It would displace some but not all income support programs; not, for example, EI or CPP, but certainly welfare.  Creating an effective complement of programs in our federal system is complex. It must ultimately be done by Governments which have access to the necessary data, expertise, and control of budget design. But so long as the basic income amount is adequate, there should be no more food insecurity and homelessness in Canada. BIG costs less than the consequences of poverty now cost us and it will bring about very substantial downstream savings. In addition, BIG, like universal health care, is there for any one facing a crisis ? in this case a financial one.? Like health care, it both acknowledges and concretizes a commitment to collective interdependence.?BIG is deliberately inclusive, proclaiming that everyone here is ?one of us? rather than ?another of them?. It will help heal our wounded body politic, and bring the satisfaction of rebuilding a just and humane country.   BIG is transformative. Recipients? ability to engage in entrepreneurial, artistic, volunteer, and political activity is enhanced; workers ability to bargain for better job conditions and wages (and to strike if necessary) is strengthened; children can focus at school as can workers on the job, both groups relieved of hunger and the many stresses attendant on poverty; high school completions increase; women abused in their homes are able to support their children if they leave the abusers; mental and physical health improve; participation in community life and democratic politics becomes more possible.  BIG is a fully developed form of ?cash transfer?. More modest income support programs are in use in many jurisdictions. There are large scale programs in Brazil, Mexico and Alaska ( the last uniquely conceived but equally effective ); the Swiss will hold a referendum soon on whether or not to implement a nationwide BIG; there are several pilot projects ongoing or recently completed in, among others, India, Namibia, London UK, and New York City.     Studies of the efficacy of these programs are being generated by scholars and activists worldwide. Positive impacts have been documented by the World Bank and the OECD . Brazil?s highly successful ? Bolsa Familia ? is supported by both the World Bank (which participated in its design) and the IMF. It has been in place since 2003 and now reaches over 50 million people. A Canadian BIG experiment ( MINCOME ) was conducted in the 1970?s in Dauphin, Manitoba. Recent analysis of MINCOME data by Dr. Evelyn Forget shows a significant reduction in health care costs and an increase in high school completion rates in less than four years? time. There was no unacceptable work disincentive ? teenage boys stayed longer in high school and mothers longer at home with infants.  Since 1986, the Basic Income Earth Network (BIEN) has served academics and BIG activists now working in more than 22 countries. BIEN has a substantial library of papers based in social science, law, gender studies, political economy, business management, intergovernmental relations, industrial relations, etc.  Canada?s BIEN affiliate, the Basic Income Canada Network , was founded in 2009, our national activist campaign, The BIG Push in 2013. The campaign?s first goal is to raise awareness and foster public discussion of BIG; second, we seek to persuade as many political actors as we can to champion the concept. To those ends, last Fall our Kingston Action Group began a drive to increase the number of BIG activist groups in Ontario and to strengthen the network among them and across the country. A list of Canadian resources , current to February 13, 2015, has been created by the co-founder of our group, Elaine Power.  The BIG Push campaign is growing at a healthy pace; however, research is needed into many different questions ? for example:   To what extent and in what jurisdictions would displacement of provincial welfare programs cause recipients to lose benefits (e.g., access to housing, dental care, eyeglasses, prescription drugs etc.) because those benefits are attached to welfare programs rather than to low income levels?  How best to design BIG to foster women?s economic equality and freedom of choice, to avoid further entrenchment and, if possible effectively counteract, existing fiscal structures which exacerbate gender inequality in income, labour force participation, career development, wealth, etc.?  What new taxes or combinations of them e.g., financial transaction, inheritance, wealth or carbon taxes, could best be used to fund BIG (low range $30-50 billion, high $100-150 billion)? How much money can each be expected to generate?  How best design BIG to stimulate small business entrepreneurship?  What impact could basic income be expected to have on mental health; what downstream mental health care savings can be reasonably projected?    My hope is that readers will be sufficiently intrigued and challenged by the BIG project to undertake more research specifically focused on issues surrounding BIG?s implementation within the Canadian federal political and fiscal systems. Supportive readers can register their support and check out other aspects of the campaign at biencanada.ca/become-involved .  Currently, in Ontario alone, there are groups in Kingston, Ottawa, Toronto, the Fort Erie Region, the Halton area region, Sault Ste. Marie, Kitchener-Waterloo, London, and Peterborough.?? St. Catharines would be in good company, if there is someone who would like to take up the challenge. Activists interested in founding a BIG Action Group, in St. Catharines or elsewhere in Canada, or who would like contact information for the group in their own area are urged to email Toni Pickard at tpickard1@cogeco.ca .  Author Biography    As a law professor at Queen?s University, Toni Pickard taught and focused her research on criminal law in addition to developing a variety of new course offerings such as Non-Adversarial Lawyering Tasks, Issues surrounding the Jury, Law and Social Theory, Empirical Research and Law, Critical Perspectives on Law. She co-authored ?Dimensions of Criminal Law? with Phil Goldman of the Queen?s Political Studies Department. Her activist work has included, e.g., anti-nuclear civil disobedience, University anti-racism advocacy and counselling, coordinating student staff and faculty efforts in the Queen?s campaign for divestment from South Africa. After retiring, she returned to her study of the cello, too long neglected. In 2013, inspired by BIG?s potential to address many of the problems facing Canada and a world dominated by neoliberal ideology and political control, she co-founded the Kingston Action Group for a Basic Income Guarantee with Professor Elaine Power of the Queen?s School of Kinesiology and Health Studies.

Amazon link   Updated to reflect recent developments in the field, Lexical-Functional Syntax , Second Edition enhances its stature as the definitive text for lexical-functional grammar (LFG) with a primary focus on syntactic structure. Representing the most accessible, empirically motivated treatment of the mathematical architecture of LFG available, the authors continue to offer a synthesis of major theoretical developments related to lexical-functional syntax and cover the wide range of cross-linguistic syntactic phenomena to which it has been applied. Updates include new sections on agreement, concord, and predication, along with morphology that supports or suppresses argument structure roles, as well as many new problem sets ? including several based on languages not featured in the first edition. Helpful feedback from readers is also incorporated into this new edition to enhance clarity. Offering illuminating insights into the syntactic framework of LFG, Lexical-Functional Syntax, Second Edition is an essential resource for all aspects of this important field.   Perspectives  Ash Asudeh and Gianluca Giorgolo, 2016  Semantics & Pragmatics 9(21) [53 pages] : http://dx.doi.org/10.3765/sp.9.21  An important problem in the philosophy of language and the linguistic study of meaning (semantics and pragmatics) concerns co-referential terms and substitutability in different contexts. This problem is now commonly associated with Frege (1892), and is often called ?Frege?s puzzle?. The puzzle can be presented in various ways, but its essence can be captured as follows: given two co-referential linguistic expressions, why is it that in certain linguistic contexts substitution of one expression for the other is truth-preserving, while in others it is not?  For example, given that (1) is true, since ?Hesperus? and ?Phosphorus? are different names for the planet Venus, how can it be that (2) can be true while (3) is false? (1) Hesperus is Phosphorus. (2) Kim believes that Hesperus is a planet. (3) Kim believes that Phosphorus is a planet. Alternatively, we could characterize the puzzle by observing that a sentence like the following can be true without entailing that Kim does not believe a tautology: (4) Kim doesn?t believe that Hesperus is Phosphorus. Frege?s own solution was that in addition to a reference, nominals have a sense, or ?mode of presentation?, and that in certain contexts, such as those involving propositional attitudes, it is these distinct senses that block substitutability. Frege?s puzzle is thus clearly related to the problem of ?referential opacity? in the study of propositional attitudes (Quine 1953, 1956, 1960). Fregean senses are not the only way to construe modes of presentation (e.g., Schiffer 1990, Fiengo & May 1998) and the notion that names, in particular, have a mode of presentation or are interpreted differently under propositional attitude verbs is not universally accepted (among many others, Kripke 1972, 1979, 1980, Recanati 1997, Richard 1990).  In this paper, we focus on linguistic aspects of substitutability/opacity. We take it for granted that there is an empirical phenomenon to be explained here ? differing truth value judgements despite substitution of co-referential terms ? and offer a formal mechanism for capturing and explaining it semantically. We follow Saul (1997, 2007) in observing that problems of substitutability also arise in ?simple sentences?. Our analysis captures these cases, too. Moreover, we also focus on cases of differential interpretation of the same expression (Kripke 1979, Castan?eda 1989, Fiengo & May 1998). Lastly, we briefly indicate how our analysis could give insight into cases other than referential expressions, as discussed by Kripke (1979). Thus, the mechanism we propose is not only formally well-founded on advances in formal logic and theoretical computer science, it also allows us to provide the beginnings of a general formal semantics of what we might informally call perspective .   Meaning and Valency  Ash Asudeh, Ida Toivonen, and Gianluca Giorgolo, 2014  [21 pages] : [ .pdf ]  In Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King, eds., Proceedings of the LFG14 Conference. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 68?88.  We draw together ideas from a number of certain recent proposals in the LFG literature for the encoding of lexical information and the sharing of this information across valencies in a generalized fashion. This forms the beginnings of a theory of the representation and specification of information that sits at the lexicon?syntax?semantics interface. Our formal ingredients are: 1. Templates; 2. Aspects of the regular language of f-descriptions, particularly optionality; 3. Resource-sensitive semantic composition, as captured by Glue Semantics. We provide analyses of passives, cognate objects and benefactives, and demonstrate that the analyses of these phenomena interact properly. We derive a system in which composition is flexible and meaning emerges from the properly constrained interaction of a variety of contributors.   Monads as a Solution for Generalized Opacity  Gianluca Giorgolo and Ash Asudeh, 2014  Published version: [9 pages] : [ .pdf ]  Proceedings of the EACL 2014 Workshop on Type Theory and Natural Language Semantics (TTNLS) . 19-27.  In this paper we discuss a conservative extension of the simply-typed lambda calculus in order to model a class of expressions that generalize the notion of opaque contexts. Our extension is based on previous work in the semantics of programming languages aimed at providing a mathematical characterization of computations that produce some kind of side effect (Moggi, 1989), and is based on the notion of monads, a construction in category theory that, intuitively, maps a collection of ?simple? values and ?simple? functions into a more complex value space, in a canonical way. The main advantages of our approach with respect to traditional analyses of opacity are the fact that we are able to explain in a uniform way a set of different but related phenomena, and that we do so in a principled way that has been shown to also explain other linguistic phenomena (Shan, 2001).   One Semiring to Rule Them All  Gianluca Giorgolo and Ash Asudeh, 2014  Submitted version: [6 pages] : [ .pdf ]  In this paper we look at the well known phenomenon of conjunction fallacies (Tversky & Kahneman, 1983) from a linguistic perspective. We are particularly interested in understanding the impact of this phenomenon on our understanding of compositionality, a core assumption of contemporary linguistic theories about language meaning. We will argue that contra Hertwig, Benz, and Krauss (2008), conjunction fallacies do not arise because of the ambiguity of coordinating conjunctions such as and, but rather because there are two different strategies available for computing the composite likelihood of a collection of events. Crucially, in our analysis the two strategies are two variants of the same underlying general structure that simultaneously allows subjects 1. to reason in purely logical terms; 2. to follow the rules of probability and 3. to commit fallacies depending on the conditions under which they evaluate linguistic expressions relating uncertain events. We will explain the choice between the two strategies in terms of cognitive/computational economy and the consequences of overestimating the likelihood of an event.   Directionality and the Production of Ungrammatical Sentences  Ash Asudeh, 2013 In Cristiano Chesi, ed., Special issue on Directionality of Phrase Structure Building,  Studies in Linguistics . 6: 83?106.  Submitted version: [23 pages] : [ .pdf ]  It is a puzzling fact that English speakers produce resumptive pronouns under certain circumstances, yet reject sentences containing resumptives as ungrammatical. This paper reviews a language production model that attempts to solve this problem through prioritization of local well-formedness over global well- formedness and, more specifically, considers the model?s implications for di- rectionality in grammar. In particular, English resumptive in islands imply that the unbounded dependencies in grammar are filler-driven, featurally defined at the top of the dependency, and that islands are identifiable by the grammar from outside the island, in a top-down fashion. Lexical-Functional Grammar provides the formal framework for incrementality in the production model, which is based on monotonic information growth in LFG grammars. LFG also pro- vides a formal, ?outside-in? theory of unbounded dependencies that treats them as filler-driven and allows island barriers to be identified from outside of the island, rather than from the inside.   Constructions with Lexical Integrity  Ash Asudeh, Mary Dalrymple and Ida Toivonen , 2013  Journal of Language Modelling . 1(1): 1?54.  Published version: [54 pages] : [ .pdf ]  Construction Grammar holds that unpredictable form-meaning combinations are not restricted in size. In particular, there may be phrases that have particular meanings that are not predictable from the words that they contain, but which are nonetheless not purely idiosyncratic. In addressing this observation, some construction grammarians have not only weakened the word/phrase distinction, but also denied the lexicon/grammar distinction. In this paper, we consider the word/phrase and lexicon/grammar distinction in light of Lexical-Functional Grammar and its Lexical Integrity Principle. We show that it is not necessary to remove the words/phrases distinction or the lexicon/grammar distinction to capture constructional effects, although we agree that there are important generalisations involving constructions of all sizes that must be captured at both syntactic and semantic levels. We use LFG?s templates , bundles of grammatical descriptions, to factor out grammatical information in such a way that it can be invoked either by words or by construction-specific phrase structure rules. Phrase structure rules that invoke specific templates are thus the equivalent of phrasal constructions in our approach, but Lexical Integrity and the separation of word and phrase are preserved. Constructional effects are captured by systematically allowing words and phrases to contribute comparable information to LFG?s level of functional structure; this is just a generalization of LFG?s usual assumption that ?morphology competes with syntax? (Bresnan 2001).   The Logic of Pronominal Resumption  2012 ? Oxford University Press OUP link ? Amazon link   This book is a cross-linguistic investigation of resumptive pronouns and related phenomena. Pronominal resumption is the realization of the base of a syntactic dependency as a bound pronoun. Resumption occurs in unbounded dependencies, such as relative clauses and questions, and in the variety of raising known as copy raising. Processing factors may also give rise to resumption, even in environments where it does not normally occur in a given language.  A new theory of resumption is proposed that is based on two key assumptions, one theoretical and one empirical/typological. The first assumption is that natural language is resource-sensitive (the Resource Sensitivity Hypothesis); this is captured through the use of a resource logic for semantic composition. The second assumption is that resumptive pronouns are ordinary pronouns in their morphological and lexical properties, based on typologically robust observations (McCloskey?s Generalization). The theory is formalized in terms of Glue Semantics for semantic composition, with a Lexical-Functional Grammar syntax.  The theory achieves a novel unification of hitherto heterogeneous resumption phenomena. It unifies two kinds of resumptive pronouns that are found in unbounded dependencies ? one kind behaves syntactically like a gap, whereas the other kind does not. It also unifies resumptive pronouns in unbounded dependencies with the obligatory pronouns in copy raising. The theory also provides the basis for a new understanding of processing-based resumption, both in production and in parsing and interpretation.  Review:  Language (Nicolas Guilliot)   ?M,?,?? Monads for conversational implicatures  Gianluca Giorgolo and Ash Asudeh, 2012  Submitted version: [30 pages] : [ .pdf ]  In Ana Aguilar Guevara, Anna Chernilovskaya, and Rick Nouwen, eds., Proceedings of Sinn und Bedeutung 16 , Volume 1. MIT Working Papers in Linguistics. 265-278.  We argue for a multidimensional approach to conventional implicatures and present a compositional approach to computing conventional implicatures based on monads. We show how a monadic approach allows us to tightly control the flow of information between dimensions. Our analysis is also based on the idea of two separate stages in the computation of the meaning of a sentence, each one regulating the flow of information in a different way. Our approach improves on previous proposals by better isolating the properties of conventional implicature and by showing precisely how their computation can be related to other semantic phenomena.   Copy raising and perception  Ash Asudeh and Ida Toivonen , 2012  Natural Language and Linguistic Theory 30(2): 321?380  Penultimate draft: [53 pages] : [ .pdf ]   Revision of Asudeh and Toivonen (2007), Copy raising and its consequences for perceptual reports , with formal analysis.  We examine copy raising in two closely related Germanic languages, English and Swedish, and offer a formal analysis of its syntax and semantics. We develop a new event semantics analysis of copy raising. In addition to augmenting the body of empirical data on copy raising, we show that copy raising yields novel insights into a number of key theoretical issues, in particular language and perception, the theory of arguments and thematic roles, and the broader semantics of control and raising.   Flexible composition for optional and derived arguments  Ash Asudeh and Gianluca Giorgolo, 2012  [20 pages] : [ .pdf ]  In Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King, eds., Proceedings of the LFG12 Conference. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 64?84.  A simple but insightful analysis of optional and derived arguments at the syntax?semantics interface is provided, based on established features of LFG with Glue Semantics (optionality and templates in lexical entries and flexible, resource-sensitive semantic composition).   Missing resources in a resource-sensitive semantics  Gianluca Giorgolo and Ash Asudeh, 2012  [20 pages] : [ .pdf  In Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King, eds., Proceedings of the LFG12 Conference. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 219?239.  In this paper, we present an investigation of the argument/adjunct distinction in the context of LFG. We focus on those cases where certain grammatical functions that qualify as arguments according to all standard tests (Needham and Toivonen, 2011) are only optionally realized. We argue for an analysis first proposed by Blom et al. (2012), and we show how we can make it work within the machinery of LFG. Our second contribution regards how we propose to interpret a specific case of optional arguments, optional objects. In this case we propose to generalize the distinction between transitive and intransitive verbs to a continuum. Purely transitive and intransitive verbs represent the extremes of the continuum. Other verbs, while leaning towards one or the other end of this spectrum, show an alternating behavior between the two extremes. We show how our first contribution is capable of accounting for these cases in terms of exceptional behavior. The key insight we present is that the verbs that exhibit the alternating behavior can best be understood as being capable of dealing with an exceptional context. In other words they display some sort of control on the way they compose with their context. This will prompt us also to rethink the place of the notion of subcategorization in the LFG architecture   Multidimensional semantics with unidimensional glue logic  Gianluca Giorgolo and Ash Asudeh, 2011  [20 pages] : [ .pdf ]  In Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King, eds., Proceedings of the LFG11 Conference. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 236-256.  We present an implementation of multidimensional semantics in Glue Semantics. Our approach differs from the proposal of Arnold and Sadler (2010) by restricting multidimensionality to the meaning language and therefore avoiding the introduction of tensors in the compositional glue logic. We use a construction from category theory ? monads ? to create structured mappings from the algebra of unidimensional semantics to the multidimensional case. Monads have already been successfully employed in theoretical computer science to provide a denotational semantics of side effects. Here we follow the suggestion of Shan (2001) to use monads to model semantic phenomena and show how monads can be used to capture the analysis of natural language expressions like appositives and expressives. We argue that monads allow us to keep the simplicity of unidimensional composition while also allowing the ability to track multiple meaning dimensions and to control information flow between these different dimensions appropriately.   Multimodal communication in LFG: Gestures and the Correspondence Architecture  Gianluca Giorgolo and Ash Asudeh, 2011  [20 pages] : [ .pdf ]  In Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King, eds., Proceedings of the LFG11 Conference. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 257-277.  In this paper we investigate the interaction between verbal language and the non-verbal behaviours that commonly accompany it. We focus on spontaneous hand gestures. We discuss the complex network of interactions between the two modalities and how we can model the interpretation of a multi-channel signal. We embed this model of interpretation in the LFG correspondence architecture and we show how the flow of linguistic information that characterizes the architecture can be used to make the interpretation more precise. The result is an enriched architecture in which a complex signal is first broken up into its component parts. The subcomponents are initially interpreted independently but are then fused at the end into a single meaning object. Our model can capture quite precisely the intuitive meaning associ- ated with multimodal utterances.   Local grammaticality in syntactic production  2011 ? [28 pages] ? ?

Stanford: CSLI Publications. 51-79  This paper considers the following question: How and why do speakers systematically produce (i.e., utter) sentences that they consider ungrammatical? The question is investigated in light of data from the production and parsing of resumptive pronouns in English, which does not have grammatically licensed resumptives in standard varieties. The paper argues that, at least in the case of English resumption, the sentences are indeed underlyingly ungrammatical, but that the language processing system nevertheless produces such sentences due to a prioritization of local well-formedness over global well-formedness.

Amsterdam: John Benjamins. 121-187  This paper presents a unified theory of resumptive pronouns, based on the Resource Management Theory of Resumption (RMTR).

Adjacency and locality: A constraint-based analysis of complementizer-adjacent extraction  2009 ? [20 pages] : [ .pdf ]  In Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King, eds., Proceedings of the LFG09 Conference. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 106-126.  This paper provides a new explanation of phenomena related to extraction following an overt complementizer (?that-t effects?), for which the theory-neutral term ?complement-adjacent extraction? is adopted. The analysis stems from the Correspondence Architecture of Lexical-Functional Grammar, making formally explicit certain implicit, native relations of the architecture. No reference is made to traces. The key insight is that complement-adjacent extraction effects concern linear string adjacency, where the string is understood as part of the syntax-phonology interface. A new metavariable is introduced and formally defined; the metavariable identifies the next word?s f-structure. A single constraint is proposed that accounts for a wide range of relevant phenomena.   Expressives and identity conditions  Christopher Potts, Ash Asudeh, Seth Cable, Yurie Hara, Eric McCready, Luis Alonso-Ovalle, Rajesh Bhatt, Christopher Davis, Angelika Kratzer, Tom Roeper and Martin Walkow, 2009  Linguistic Inquiry 40(2): 356-366  Prepublication draft [12 pages] : [ .pdf ]   We present diverse evidence for the claim of Pullum and Rawlins (2007) that expressives behave differently from descriptives in constructions that enforce a particular kind of semantic identity between elements. Our data are drawn from a wide variety of languages and construction types, and they point uniformly to a basic linguistic distinction between descriptive content and expressive content (Kaplan 1999; Potts 2007).   Lexical-Functional Grammar  Ash Asudeh and Ida Toivonen , 2009  Prepublication draft [32 pages] : [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  In Bernd Heine and Heiko Narrog, eds., The Oxford Handbook of Linguistic Analysis . Oxford: Oxford University Press. 425-458.  Lexical-Functional Grammar (LFG) is a lexicalist, declarative (non-transformational), constraint-based theory of generative grammar. LFG has a detailed, industrial-strength computational implementation. The theory has also proven useful for descriptive/documentary linguistics. The grammatical architecture of LFG, sometimes called the ?Correspondence Architecture?, posits that different kinds of linguistic information are modelled by distinct, simultaneously present grammatical structures, each having its own formal representation. These separate structures are formally related by correspondence functions. The different grammatical structures are subject to separate principles and formal descriptions and have distinct primitives. The two core syntactic structures are constituent structure and functional structure, and they are the central focus of this chapter. Other grammatical structures that have been proposed concern argument structure, information structure, semantics and the syntax?semantics interface, prosody and the syntax?phonology interface, and the morphology?syntax interface.   Constructions with Lexical Integrity: Templates as the lexicon-syntax interface  Ash Asudeh, Mary Dalrymple and Ida Toivonen , 2008 [21 pages] : [ .pdf ]  In Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King, eds., Proceedings of the LFG08 Conference. Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 68-88.  LFG differs from Construction Grammar (CG) in assuming a strict separation between the lexicon and the syntax. The LFG architecture and the principle of Lexical Integrity dictate that fully inflected words are ?inserted? one by one into the c-structure, which does not seem to permit the blurring of the boundary between words and larger syntactic units that CG advocates. This paper addresses the question of how the intuitions behind constructions (in the CG sense) can be formalized within LFG, without rejection of the foundational assumptions behind the LFG framework. The key insight in our approach is the use of LFG templates (Dalrymple et al. 2004, Crouch et al. 2008) to factor out grammatical information in such a way that it can be invoked either by lexical items or by specific c-structure rules. C-structure rules that invoke specific templates are thus the equivalent of constructions in our approach, but Lexical Integrity and the separation of lexicon and syntax are preserved.   Automatic extraction of translations from web-based bilingual materials  Qibo Zhu , Diana Inkpen and Ash Asudeh, 2007  Machine Translation 21(3): 139-163.  Published version [25 pages]  MT website (SpringerLink): [ .pdf ] Password-protected local copy ? contact , ? Springer: [ .pdf ]  This paper describes the framework of the StatCan Daily Translation Extraction System (SDTES), a computer system that maps and compares web-based translation texts of Statistics Canada (StatCan) news releases in the StatCan publication The Daily. The goal is to extract translations for translation memory systems, for translation terminology building, for cross-language information retrieval and for corpus-based machine translation systems. Three years of officially published statistical news release texts at http:// www.statcan.ca were collected to compose the StatCan Daily data bank. The English and French texts in this collection were roughly aligned using the Gale-Church statistical algorithm. After this, boundary markers of text segments and paragraphs were adjusted and the Gale-Church algorithm was run a second time for a more fine-grained text segment alignment. To detect misaligned areas of texts and to prevent mismatched translation pairs from being selected, key textual and structural properties of the mapped texts were automatically identified and used as anchoring features for comparison and misalignment detection. The proposed method has been tested with web-based bilingual materials from five other Canadian government websites. Results show that the SDTES model is very efficient in extracting translations from published government texts, and very accurate in identifying mismatched translations. With parameters tuned, the text-mapping part can be used to align corpus data collected from official government websites; and the text-comparing component can be applied in prepublication translation quality control and in evaluating the results of statistical machine translation systems.

Cambridge University Press: [ .pdf ]  David Adger raises some interesting issues and makes several valuable points in his ?Remarks on Minimalist feature theory and Move? (henceforth MFTM), a response to our review article ?Symptomatic imperfections? (henceforth SI) in this journal (Asudeh & Toivonen 2006), which was in part a review of his Core syntax (Adger 2003). In this response, we address some of the points in MFTM. We would also like to set the record straight about some points in SI which we feel have been misrepresented. In several instances, MFTM argues against claims that were not made in SI. Whatever the independent merit of these arguments, we do not wish to defend viewpoints we did not propose in the first place.

Cambridge University Press: [ .pdf ]  Review article on: David Adger, Core syntax: a Minimalist approach . Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2003. Andrew Radford, Minimalist syntax: exploring the structure of English . Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.  Minimalist syntax and Core syntax are reasonably good textbooks. They should be very helpful indeed in teaching a syntax course on current Principles and Parameters Theory (P&P; Chomsky 1981) that focuses on the Minimalist Program (MP; Chomsky 1995, 2000, 2001, 2004, 2005). The books present a range of syntactic phenomena, which are for the most part discussed lucidly and illustrated by considerable relevant data. Nevertheless, the books are not pedagogically faultless and the pedagogical faults are often due to underlying theoretical problems.  Although the Minimalist Program has opened up new research avenues for Principles and Parameters Theory, it has left the analytical part of the theory in poor condition. The theoretical flaws in these textbooks are symptomatic of problems in the Minimalist Program at large and, in the bulk of this review article, we use the books to explore underlying problems with the programmatic Minimalist approach to P&P theory. Consideration of these issues reveals Minimalism to be, at heart, a kind of unification-based, lexicalist framework, but one which eschews formalisation or even just explicitness (contra Chomsky 1957) ? with attendant deleterious consequences ? and which refuses to give up the unnecessary mechanism of movement, even though it has arguably outgrown it.   Binding theory  Ash Asudeh and Mary Dalrymple , 2006 In Keith Brown, ed., Encyclopedia of language and linguistics (2nd edition). Amsterdam: Elsevier. Vol. 2: 23-31.  Published version [9 pages]  ELL2 website (ScienceDirect): [ .pdf ] Password-protected local copy ? contact , ? Elsevier: [ .pdf ]  Binding theory accounts for whether a nominal expression can, must, or must not refer to the same individual as some other nominal in the sentence. Coreference possibilities for a pronoun like him or herself are determined by binding conditions on the relation between the pronoun and its antecedent, the nominal that a pronoun depends on for its reference. Binding theory is typically formulated on some syntactic representation. Three aspects are important in determining proper and improper binding relations: the class of nominal, the syntactic domain within which binding must or must not hold, and the syntactic relation between a nominal and its potential binder.

Published version [47 pages]  JL website (Cambridge Journals Online): [ .pdf ] Local copy (provided by permission), ? Cambridge University Press: [ .pdf ]  This paper examines tensions between the syntax of control and semantic resource sensitivity. Structure sharing of controller and control target leads to apparent resource deficit under certain circumstances. An analysis is presented using Glue Semantics for Lexical Functional Grammar. It demonstrates that structure sharing and resource sensitivity can be reconciled without giving up or relaxing either notion. It is shown that the analysis can handle either property or propositional denotations for controlled complements. The analysis is extended to finite controlled complements, which raise the opposing problem of resource surplus . A solution is proposed and its typological implications discussed. The syntax and semantics of control as structure sharing is compared to a recent anaphoric control analysis by Dalrymple (2001). Based on facts of exhaustive and partial control, the present analysis is argued to be superior.   Relational nouns, pronouns, and resumption  2005  Linguistics and Philosophy 28(4): 375-446.  Published version [72 pages]  L&P website (SpringerLink): [ .pdf ] Password-protected local copy ? contact , ? Springer: [ .pdf ]  This paper presents a variable-free analysis of relational nouns in Glue Semantics, within a Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) architecture. Relational nouns and resumptive pronouns are bound using the usual binding mechanisms of LFG. Special attention is paid to the bound readings of relational nouns, how these interact with genitives and obliques, and their behaviour with respect to scope, crossover and reconstruction. I consider a puzzle that arises regarding relational nouns and resumptive pronouns, given that relational nouns can have bound readings and resumptive pronouns are just a specific instance of bound pronouns. The puzzle is: why is it impossible for bound implicit arguments of relational nouns to be resumptive? The puzzle is highlighted by a well known variety of variable-free semantics, where pronouns and relational noun phrases are identical both in category and (base) type. I show that the puzzle also arises for an established variable-based theory. I present an analysis of resumptive pronouns that crucially treats resumptives in terms of the resource logic linear logic that underlies Glue Semantics: a resumptive pronoun is a perfectly ordinary pronoun that constitutes a surplus resource; this surplus resource requires the presence of a resumptive-licensing resource consumer, a manager resource . Manager resources properly distinguish between resumptive pronouns and bound relational nouns, based on differences between them at the level of semantic structure. The resumptive puzzle is thus solved. The paper closes by considering the solution in light of the hypothesis of direct compositionality. It is argued that a directly compositional version of the theory is possible, although perhaps not desirable. The implications for direct compositionality are considered.   Avoiding attachment ambiguities: The role of constituent ordering  Jennifer E. Arnold , Thomas Wasow , Ash Asudeh and Peter Alrenga , 2004  Journal of Memory and Language 51(1): 55-70.  Published version [16 pages]  JML website (ScienceDirect): [ .pdf ] Password-protected local copy ? contact , ? Elsevier: [ .pdf ]  Three experiments investigated whether speakers use constituent ordering as a mechanism for avoiding ambiguities. In utterances like ?Jane showed the letter to Mary to her mother,? alternate orders would avoid the temporary PP- attachment ambiguity (?Jane showed her mother the letter to Mary,? or ?Jane showed to her mother the letter to Mary?). A preference judgment experiment confirmed that comprehenders prefer the latter orders for dative utterances when the former order would have contained an ambiguity. Nevertheless, speakers in two on-line production experiments showed no evidence of an ambiguity avoidance strategy. In fact, they were slightly more likely to use the former order when it was ambiguous than when it was not. Speakers? failure to disambiguate with ordering cannot be explained by the use of other ambiguity mechanisms, like prosody. A prosodic analysis of the responses in Experiment 3 showed that while speakers generally produced prosodic patterns that were consistent with the syntactic structure, these patterns would not strongly disambiguate the PP-attachment ambiguity. We suggest that speakers do not consistently disambiguate local PP-attachment ambiguities of this type, and in particular do not use constituent ordering for this purpose. Instead, constituent ordering is driven by factors like syntactic weight and lexical bias, which may be internal to the production system.   Honorific marking: Interpreted and interpretable  Ash Asudeh and Christopher Potts , 2004 Paper presented (by Chris Potts) at the Phi Workshop , McGill University, August 28, 2004. 30 pages: [ .pdf ]   A licensing theory for Finnish  2003 In Diane C. Nelson and Satu Manninen (eds.), Generative approaches to Finnic and Saami linguistics . Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 165-199. 33 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  A licensing theory specifies a tripartite relation between thematic roles, grammatical functions, and grammatical case. I present a licensing theory for Finnish based on recent Optimality Theory (OT) work by Kiparsky (2001). However, the account presented here uses default unification (Lascarides and Copestake 1999), rather than OT. I argue that this yields a more restrictive licensing theory that nevertheless has several of OT?s hallmarks, including violable constraints, typological prediction, and emergence of the unmarked. Thus, this work makes two principal contributions: 1) it provides a licensing theory for Finnish with considerable empirical coverage, predicting the distribution of objects with various grammatical cases, as well as the distribution of VP-external ([Spec, IP]) and VP-internal subjects, and adnominal genitives; 2) it showcases default unification as an alternative to Optimality Theory.   A resource-sensitive semantics for equi and raising  2002 In David Beaver, Stefan Kaufmann, Brady Clark, and Luis Casillas (eds.), The construction of meaning . Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 1-21. 21 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) analyses of equi and raising in- volve functional control equations, which structure-share the values of grammatical functions, making them token-identical at the level of f(unctional)-structure. Glue semantics for LFG works from f-structure and is resource-sensitive. This seems at rst to be incompatible with structure-sharing. It is demonstrated that this is not so. By using LFG?s parallel projection architecture, the Glue analysis of equi proposed here treats the clausal equi complement as denoting a property, which has been argued for on independent grounds by Chierchia (1984). It is also shown that the same approach can provide an analysis of raising in which clausal complements of raising verbs denote propositions, as required. The anal- ysis also explains the ability of raising verbs to take expletive subjects and the inability of equi verbs to do so.

Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 1-18. 18 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  It is shown that five apparently irreconcilable claims about the clausal syntax of Irish can be reconciled in a natural, base-generated LFG analysis that builds on the standard LFG theory of endocentricity and coheads/extended heads, the LFG projection architecture, and Toivonen?s (2001) work on non-projecting categories and c-structure adjunction. The analysis also builds on McCloskey?s (1996) analysis of Irish adjunction, but does not posit complementizer lowering. The principal theoretical consequences of the analysis are 1) the reconciliation of the five claims, in particular a synthesis of McCloskey?s position that the Irish preverbal particles are complementizers and Sells?s (1984) position that they are head-adjoined to the verb, 2) the elaboration of Toivonen?s (2001) theory of c-structure adjunction, 3) correct predictions about not only adjunction to matrix and subordinate clauses, but also adjunction to appositives.   Coordination and parallelism in Glue Semantics: Integrating discourse cohesion and the Element Constraint  Ash Asudeh and Richard Crouch, 2002 In Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King (eds.), Proceedings of the LFG02 Conference . Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 19-39. 20 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  We present initial work on a theory of coordination and parallelism in Glue Semantics (GLUE; Dalrymple 1999, 2001). We will explore points of convergence and divergence between our approach to coordination and similar Categorial Grammar (CG) approaches. We also compare our approach to a previous GLUE approach to coordination (Kehler et al. 1995, 1999) and argue that our approach is superior on the grounds that it preserves a very strong notion of resource-sensitivity (Dalrymple et al. 1993). We conclude by discussing parallelism in connection with the Coordinate Structure Constraint (CSC; Ross 1967). The CSC is a putatively robust condition on extraction which has been argued to be a feature of the CG approach to coordination and of other related approaches. It is standardly assumed to have two parts, the Conjunct Constraint and the Element Constraint (Grosu 1973). The Conjunct Constraint is quite robust, but the Element Constraint has been challenged repeatedly, most recently by Kehler (2002), who argues that the CSC is not a syntactic condition, but rather follows from conditions on discourse coherence and parallelism. We discuss a constraint language on the structure of GLUE derivations, and show how Kehler?s theory of discourse cohesion can be related to parallelism in such derivations.

International HPSG Conference . Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 1-19. 19 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  The glue approach to semantic interpretation has been developed principally for Lexical Functional Grammar. Recent work has shown how glue can be used with a variety of syntactic theories and this paper outlines how it can be applied to HPSG. As well as providing an alternative form of semantics for HPSG, we believe that the benefits of HPSG glue include the following: (1) simplification of the Semantics Principle; (2) a simple and elegant treatment of modifier scope, including empirical phenomena like quantifier scope ambiguity, the interaction of scope with raising, and recursive modification; (3) an analysis of control that handles agreement between controlled subjects and their coarguments while allowing for a property denotation for the controlled clause; (4) re-use of highly efficient techniques for semantic derivation already implemented for LFG, and which target problems of ambiguity management also addressed by Minimal Recursion Semantics.   Shape conditions and phonological context  Ash Asudeh and Ewan Klein , 2002 In Frank van Eynde, Lars Hellan and Dorothee Beermann (eds.), Proceedings of the 8th. International HPSG Conference . Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 20-30. 10 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  This paper builds on Zwicky?s (1986) notion of shape condition , that is, a rule that specifies the phonological shape of inflected forms ?by reference to triggers at least some of which lie outside the syntactic word?. Zwicky observes that ?many rules traditionally classified as external sandhi rules are [shape conditions]?. They are not phonological rules in the usual sense, since they only apply to specific lexical items and are active within syntactic rather than phonological domains.  Shape conditions are problematic in many standard grammar architectures. On the one hand, they seem to be constraints on lexical entries, while on the other hand, they make reference to the syntactic context. Hayes (1990) has sketched a theory of ?precompiled phrasal phonology? in which allomorph choice is conditioned by syntactic frames stated in lexical entries. However, his approach is not formalized in any detail, and begs the question of how lexicalised syntactic frames fit into the overall grammar. Although they could be identified with subcategorization frames, this would make the implicit claim that the relation between a shape condition target and its triggers can be equated with the syntactic relation between a lexical head and its complement. Although this assumption holds good for the Hausa phenomena he addresses, we do not believe that it holds in general.  HPSG appears to offer a promising framework for formalizing something like Hayes? approach, but the standard machinery also makes it hard to distinguish a shape condition trigger from a complement. In order to overcome this difficulty, we develop the notion of phonological context : a feature of signs which allows us to condition allomorphic alternation in terms of (i) the phonological edges, and (ii) the syntactic properties of an expression?s immediate syntactic sisters. We show how our analysis deals with four illustrative cases: the indefinite article alternation in English, syncretic liaison forms for possessive pronouns in French, Hausa verb-final vowel shortening, and soft mutation in Welsh nouns.   Probabilistic Learning Algorithms and Optimality Theory  Frank Keller and Ash Asudeh, 2002  Linguistic Inquiry , 33(2): 225-244. 19 pages: [ .pdf  This article provides a critical assessment of the Gradual Learning Algorithm (GLA) for probabilistic optimality-theoretic (OT) grammars proposed by Boersma and Hayes (2001). We discuss the limitations of a standard algorithm for OT learning and outline how the GLA attempts to overcome these limitations. We point out a number of serious shortcomings with the GLA: (a) A methodological problem is that the GLA has not been tested on unseen data, which is standard practice in computational language learning. (b) We provide counterexamples, that is, attested data sets that the GLA is not able to learn. (c) Essential algorithmic properties of the GLA (correctness and convergence) have not been proven formally. (d) By modeling frequency distributions in the grammar, the GLA conflates the notions of competence and performance. This leads to serious conceptual problems, as OT crucially relies on the competence/performance distinction.   Linking, optionality, and ambiguity in Marathi  2001 In Peter Sells (ed.), Formal and empirical issues in optimality-theoretic syntax . Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 257-312.     56 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]    Password-protected: Please contact me      Optimality Theory (OT) has problems with ineffability, optionality, and ambiguity, because OT grammars typically pick exactly one winner for any input. This paper take steps to accommodate ambiguity and optionality in Optimality Theory syntax. I briefly present the basic architecture of standard Optimality Theory and how it relates to ineffability, ambiguity, and optionality, and I argue that optionality and ambiguity in OT are formally the same, the first operating in production and the second in comprehension. After discussing four possible ways of capturing optionality and ambiguity in OT, I argue that Boersma?s stochastic OT model provides the most satisfactory way of dealing with these two phenomena in OT. Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) provides a formalization of the inputs, GEN, and the candidates for OT syntax. My analysis is thus formalized with a stochastic OT-LFG model.  Using this model with Dowty?s theory of proto-roles, I give an analysis of optionality in linking arguments to grammatical functions in Marathi. In doing so, I will illustrate four main points. The first is that linking can be achieved with a small set of cross-linguisically plausible, violable constraints. Second, optionality can be captured in OT syntax by modifying the architecture of the theory only slightly. Third, in comprehension-directed optimization, the same OT constraints that are used to capture the linking optionality in production can also capture the resulting ambiguity in the Marathi strings that correspond to the winning candidates in production. Fourth, this OT approach to linking has interesting implications for proto-role theory.

Annual Conference of the Cognitive Science Society , 483-488. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates. 483-488. 6 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  Binding theory is the component of grammar that regulates the interpretation of noun phrases. Certain syntactic configurations involving picture noun phrases~(PNPs) are problematic for the standard formulation of binding theory, which has prompted competing proposals for revisions of the theory. Some authors have proposed an account based on structural constraints, while others have argued that anaphors in PNPs are exempt from binding theory, but subject to pragmatic restrictions. In this paper, we present an experimental study that aims to resolve this dispute. The results show that structural factors govern the binding possibilities in PNPs, while pragmatic factors play only a limited role. However, the structural factors identified differ from the ones standardly assumed.   Argument structure and animacy restrictions on anaphora  2000 In Steve S. Chang, Lily Liaw, and Josef Ruppenhofer (eds.), Proceedings of the Berkeley Linguistics Society 25 . 2-13. 12 pages: [ abstract | .pdf | .ps.gz ]  This paper presents a theory of syntactic binding defined on the level of argument structure within the framework of Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar (Pollard and Sag, 1994). The particular focus is on three construction types: Super Equi-NP Deletion, Picture NPs, and anaphors in nominal specifier positions.  The case of Picture NPs especially has been vexing for syntactic theories of binding (e.g. Chomsky, 1986, Pollard and Sag, 1994). One previous solution has been to complicate binding theory to account for these cases (Chomsky, 1986). However, Pollard and Sag (1994) have shown that the resulting predictions are inaccurate, and the theory is therefore complicated with no large descriptive or explanatory gain. But, their own solution is also unsatisfying, since it treats Picture NP anaphora (and the other two cases) as being exempt from syntactic binding and subject solely to processing and discourse constraints (which they do not explicitly define).  The theory presented here extends recent work in HPSG that has moved the locus of binding theory to argument structure (ARG-ST) lists (Manning, 1996; Manning and Sag, 1998) by proposing a new syntactic constraint. This constraint crucially uses the representational power of HPSG to include a requirement of animacy on certain potential antecedents of anaphors, the Antecedent Closeness Constraint (ACC). The ACC moves the HPSG binding theory out of the realm of the strictly syntactic, capturing insights from functional accounts (e.g., Kuno, 1987) about the information needed to compute the antecedents of reflexives and reciprocals. However, the ACC is superior to existing functional accounts, because it simultaneously captures syntactic and semantic restrictions on the antecedent-anaphor relationship in an explicit and predictive manner, by using the formalism of HPSG. At the same time, it captures a range of data that have been shown to be problematic for purely syntactic theories of binding.   Functional identity and resource-sensitivity in control  2000 In Miriam Butt and Tracy Holloway King (eds.), Proceedings of the LFG00 Conference . Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 2-24. [ .pdf ]  Glue semantics provides a semantics for Lexical Functional Grammar (LFG) that is expressed using linear logic and provides an interpretation for the f(unctional)-structure level of syntactic representation, connecting it to the level of s(emantic)-structure in LFG?s parallel projection architecture. Due to its use of linear logic for meaning assembly, Glue is resource-sensitive: semantic resources contributed by lexical entries and resulting f-structures must each be used in a successful proof exactly once. In this paper, I will examine the tension between a resource-sensitive semantics which interprets f-structures and structure-sharing in f-structures as expressed by functional control resulting from lexical functional identity equations. The empirical phenomenon I concentrate on is equi, also known as obligatory control. Although at first blush it seems that structure-sharing poses a serious problem for Glue semantics, I will show that this is not so. In fact, this tension leads to a very restrictive theory, and the analysis I present here solves several long-standing problems in the semantics of equi, by exploiting LFG?s grammatical architecture.   Constraints on linguistic coreference: An experimental investigation of exempt anaphors  Frank Keller and Ash Asudeh, 2000 Ms., University of Edinburgh and Stanford University 6 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  Previous experimental studies (Gordon and Hendrick, 1997) demonstrated that native speakers? judgments of the coreference possibilities for (non-reflexive) pronouns systematically diverge from the predictions of linguistic binding theory. We extend these results to the coreference possibilities for syntactic anaphors (reflexives). In particular, we deal with the binding of anaphors and pronouns as they occur in picture~NPs. We show, contrary to the predictions of binding theory, that in picture~NPs, anaphors are systematically preferred over pronouns. Furthermore, such anaphors can take remote binders, even when there is a local, intervening nominal. This entails that such anaphors are always exempt from binding theory, contrary to the claims in the literature. We also demonstrate that the same factors that influence the exempt status of anaphors play a role in extraction from picture~NPs. This result indicates that both phenomena should be mediated by the same grammatical representations.   Incorporation in Danish: Implications for interfaces  Ash Asudeh and Line Hove Mikkelsen , 2000 In Ronnie Cann, Claire Grover, and Philip Miller (eds.), Grammatical interfaces in HPSG . Stanford, CA: CSLI Publications. 1-15. 15 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]   Anaphora and argument structure: Topics in the syntax and semantics of reflexives and reciprocals  1998 M.Phil. Thesis, Centre for Cognitive Science, University of Edinburgh. 158 pages: [ .pdf | .ps.gz ]  This thesis presents an examination of the syntactic and semantic properties of natural language reflexive and reciprocal expressions, which are commonly referred to as anaphors in syntactic theory. The work is carried out in the broader context of `binding theory? and `control theory?. Binding theory has two main aspects. The first aspect is to explain the distribution of nominal expressions in natural language sentences. The second aspect is to link this syntactic representation to a theory of natural language semantics, such that the semantics is constrained by the syntactic relationships between nominals. Control theory is about the interpretation of understood (phonetically null) arguments of complements to a certain class of predicates that are characterized semantically. The syntactic framework assumed is Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar (HPSG). In this framework, binding theory and control theory are intimately tied together through the syntax of reflexives.  The binding and control theories developed here are based on a level of representation called `argument structure?. Argument structure is construed as an abstract linking representation between the level of (lexical) semantics and the level of syntactically relevant grammatical relations. It is defined as a representation of the other expressions that a given word or phrase must combine with in order to be semantically and syntactically saturated. A strong interpretation of this definition is assumed here: all syntactically and semantically relevant arguments are present at the level of argument structure.  There are four main goals in this thesis: first, to extend and revise problematic previous versions of the theories of binding and control in HPSG; second, to examine the implications that these revisions and related phenomena have for the representation of argument structure; third, to develop a general program for the interpretation of the index notation used in binding theory; fourth, to test whether reciprocal expressions should be represented in the semantics as quantifiers or plurals.  The outline of the thesis is as follows. Chapter one presents an introduction to the issues involved and a brief discussion of the framework. The HPSG theories of binding and control are presented and formalized in chapter two. There are various problems that ensue which are discussed therein. In chapter three, an extended binding theory is presented. This theory consists of a simplified core, which solves certain of the problems noted in chapter two, and a new constraint on the distribution of anaphora called the Antecedent Closeness Constraint. The coverage of the extended binding theory is demonstrated. In chapter four, the interplay between argument structure and control theory is explored, and several new problems are discussed. A revised control theory is presented which deals with these problems, as well as the ones discussed in chapter two. The coverage of the revised control theory is presented. This includes a demonstration of the application of the Antecedent Closeness Constraint to controlled complements. The fifth chapter presents a program for interpreting indices, with specific reference to Discourse Representation Theory. The chapter ends with a discussion of logophoric reflexives in English. The sixth chapter presents a discussion of reciprocal interpretation, with specific attention paid to whether the reciprocal is a plural or a quantifier.   Share: Twitter , Facebook  Short URL:

We are starting the second year with our recently updated programs. Our Business Focus provides a path to the entrepreneurship certificate offered by our Faculty of Business and our Science Focus allows an extensive choice of electives from the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies. Read More . . .  What's New?  Elective Restructuring: We have redesigned our programs to allow more flexibility in the choice of electives, including the reduction of the number of required mathematics courses, leaving additional mathematics courses as possible electives (a path students are strongly encouraged to pursue). The additional elective flexibility in the Science Focus allows students to pursue any area of interest that is offered by the Faculty of Science and Environmental Studies.    Health Informatics: The emphasis is on computing technologies (cloud, big data, web) that are related to computational aspects of health care. Gaming Programming Specialization: We recently introduced a game programming specialization. To obtain this designation a specific set of Computer Science courses is required along with a related elective approved by the department. The specific computing courses are: Computer Graphics, Artificial Intelligence, Game Programming, and the Advanced Game Programming Project. These computing courses either have significant game programming applications or are entirely focused on game programming.  Mobile Computing: We have recently acquired a number of cell phones and tablets to support the growing mobile computing component of our curriculum. As part of this effort we have introduced a new computer science course in mobile computing at the second year level Bioinformatics: We are a partner in the bioinformatics program initiative, serving the needs of Thunder Bay and the region.
